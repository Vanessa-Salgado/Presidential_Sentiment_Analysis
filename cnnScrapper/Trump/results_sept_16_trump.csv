Trump is launching another business full of potential risks and conflicts if he wins | CNN Politics,"Published 3:00 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T19:00:19.790Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-business/index.html,"Donald Trump on Monday will unveil a new cryptocurrency business during an evening address from his Mar-a-Lago estate, the latest venture that stands to benefit the former president as he seeks another four years in the Oval Office. Details on the new business, which will be called World Liberty Financial, are limited, but Trump’s sons have spent weeks promoting it. The GOP nominee himself has teased the latest expansion of his family’s business empire from the same social media account that carries his political messaging. “We’re embracing the future with crypto, and leaving the slow and outdated big banks behind,” Trump wrote on X as he invited his followers to tune in to Monday’s announcement. The virtual event is expected to proceed as planned despite Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on Trump while golfing at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida. No major party nominee has ever leveraged their candidacy for personal profit quite like Trump has during his third White House bid. Since entering the race nearly two years ago, Trump has netted millions of dollars selling new items featuring moments from his political life while also generating billions of dollars in wealth through a social media site where he speaks directly to supporters. His fans can buy coffee table books featuring pictures and letters from his presidency or, if they prefer, a Trump-themed Bible. He has sold $399 golden sneakers and recently advertised to supporters “fifty all new stunning digital trading cards” for purchase at a cost of $99 each. Buy 75 and get access to a dinner gala with Trump, plus pieces of a suit he wore in his debate against President Joe Biden. “These cards show me dancing and even holding some bitcoins,” Trump said in a video posted to Truth Social. But this latest enterprise, taking off just 50 days before the election, comes with a hornets nest of ethical conflicts should Trump win in November. On the campaign trail, the former president has promised to usher in a wave of policies favorable to digital currencies as he courted the votes and financial support of the bitcoin community. Now, a company he is helping to get off the ground could stand to benefit from the actions he takes in the Oval Office. There’s little precedent for a candidate creating such obvious overlapping obligations so close to an election, said Jordan Libowitz with the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “You generally see presidential candidates try to separate themselves from their conflicts of interest instead of bringing new ones into the fold,” Libowitz said. “It’s definitely new to see a president launching a new company while also at the same time talking up new policies that would potentially directly affect that company.” Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt who studies financial regulation and cryptocurrencies, said Trump’s new undertaking also raises questions about what would happen if it necessitates enforcement action by the next administration. It’s a reality that “needs to be taken seriously,” Yadav said, given the financial risks of a project that may attract hackers and investors “purely based on the celebrity of the former president and his family.” No law requires presidents to divest from their wealth before taking office, but those who have held the office have traditionally gone to great effort to assure voters they had disentangled their executive decision making from their personal finances to prevent even the appearance of impropriety. President Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a blind trust before he took office. President Ronald Reagan and his Vice President George H.W. Bush moved their considerable wealth into trusts, too. Trump, though, shattered historical norms in his first term when he turned over his businesses to his two sons instead of divesting or shielding himself from the management of the family’s transnational conglomerate. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about these concerns, while also insisting that his latest project would not distract from the former president’s intensifying race against Vice President Kamala Haris, now in the home stretch. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung argued that Trump has “out-worked” Harris and would continue to. “There is nobody more committed than President Trump to save America from the weak, failed, and dangerously liberal policies of Kamala,” Cheung said. Trump was a businessman long before he entered politics and he has cashed in on his fame for decades, putting his name on everything from buildings to steaks. The businesses Trump has launched while campaigning have proven quite lucrative for the lifelong dealmaker. Trump made about $7.2 million in 2023 through a licensing deal with NFT INT, LLC, the company that is selling digital NFT, or non-fungible token, “trading cards” featuring the former president, according to financial disclosures he filed in August. In December, Trump began selling special edition NFTs featuring his Georgia mugshot after he was indicted on charges related to his failed attempts to overturn the 2020 election there. Those willing to buy the full set were offered a special physical card with pieces of the blue suit and red tie Trump wore in the photo. The price? $4,653. Advertisements of Trump promoting the NFT deals are shot in nearly identical fashion to videos his campaign released of the former president announcing his agenda for a second term. In both the infomercials and the campaign videos, Trump, wearing a navy suit, appears positioned with American flags on either side of him as he makes a direct-to-camera pitch from inside the same Mar-a-Lago room. “It was a great suit, believe me, a really good suit,” Trump said in the video for the mugshot NFTs. “It’s all cut up, and you’re gonna get a piece of it.” Trump reported making more than $5 million through another business, CIC Ventures LLC, largely in royalties from his books “Letters to Trump” and “Our Journey Together.” He also reported making $300,000 in royalties from “The Greenwood Bible,” a venture associated with country singer Lee Greenwood. The bibles have since been renamed the “God Bless the USA Bible” after the Greenwood anthem that plays when Trump enters his campaign events. “Happy Holy Week! Let’s Make America Pray Again. As we lead into Good Friday and Easter, I encourage you to get a copy of the God Bless the USA Bible,” Trump wrote in a March social media post that directed his supporters to a website selling the book for $59.99. The launch of these new licensing deals and products have come as mounting legal bills and court defeats have proven costly for the former president. His line of golden sneakers debuted a day after a Manhattan judge ordered Trump to pay over $454 million as part of a civil fraud case. He first hawked the shoes at a Philadelphia conference for sneakerheads, and then appeared hours later at a rally in Michigan – an illustration of how Trump has also mixed business with the campaign trail. The largest share of Trump’s net worth, at least on paper, is his ownership share of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of the Truth Social social media network he started in his post presidency after he was kicked off other sites. Trump reported in his disclosure owning nearly 115 million shares of the company’s common stock. Speaking to reporters Friday in Los Angeles, he insisted he had no plans to sell his majority stake in Trump Media. A lockup clause that prevents Trump from shedding shares until six months after the company went public is scheduled to end later this month. The episode provided an example of how the former president, in a matter of moments, can cause his net worth to fluctuate by nine figures just by opening his mouth. Trump Media stock, which has fallen sharply in recent months, jumped 25% after Trump’s remarks Friday. Perhaps none of Trump’s post-presidency endeavors to date, however unusual, present the potential for ethical quandaries quite like his next venture. Trump has yet to divulge the extent of his involvement, and other details about World Liberty Financial remain sparse. The former president is expected to explain more Monday night when he delivers what is being billed as a “State of Crypto Address” from Mar-a-Lago. But in launching World Liberty Financial, Trump and his family are entering a nascent industry that has clashed with federal regulators as it seeks to gain legitimacy. The next president is certain to confront questions about whether to put guardrails around or encourage growth in this burgeoning but highly speculative sector of financial technology. “He would be in a position to directly impact the fortunes of this company,” Libowitz said. Trump, who once dismissed bitcoin as “not money,” has already made several cryptocurrency-friendly policy commitments. He pledged to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whose bearish outlook on cryptocurrency has made him a regular target of their scorn, and promised to create a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump told the industry’s largest annual gathering this summer. His support came as cryptocurrency leaders and investors have donated millions of dollars to his campaign and aligned political committees. Trump’s campaign has not explained the former president’s 180-degree turn on bitcoin or the potential conflicts raised by this new crypto project. Brian Hughes, an adviser for the campaign, told CNN in a statement that Trump “is ready to encourage American leadership in this and other emerging technologies.” While Trump’s about face on bitcoin was cheered on by the industry, there is growing concern that his personal interest in cryptocurrency is the latest example of a celebrity looking to capitalize on a buzzy new investment opportunity. “A lot of projects have been building in this space for years with experienced teams and audited systems,” said Gareth Rhodes, an attorney at the regulatory firm Pacific Street and a former financial regulator for the state of New York. “Is this going to be part of that group of companies or is it more of a barometer of his political prospects like a meme coin or his media stock, which fluctuates whether people think he’s going to win the election?” “Most people I talk to think it’s going to be in the latter camp but they’re waiting to see what the product is,” Rhodes added. There are also potential security risks of having a president closely involved in an industry that has already suffered serious setbacks from high-profile fraud cases as well as orchestrated hacks by nefarious actors, sometimes in foreign countries. Nic Carter, a crypto investor who supports Trump, warned on X that the new company would be “the juiciest DeFi target ever” for hackers, using a shorthand term for “decentralized finance.” “At best it’s an unnecessary distraction, at worst it’s a huge embarrassment and source of (additional) legal trouble,” Carter wrote. Yadav, the Vanderbilt professor, agreed, saying it could “damage his credibility as the crypto-president if the venture fails or results in members of his voter base losing their funds.” Already, hackers posted messages on X accounts of Trump’s daughter Tiffany and his daughter-in-law Lara that linked their followers to a fake World Liberty Financial website. Meanwhile, the biography for the real X account of World Liberty Financial reads like an omen of these potential pitfalls. “Beware of Scams!” it says. “Fake tokens & airdrop offers are circulating. We aren’t live yet!”"

Trump’s social media stock reacts to latest security scare | CNN Business,"Published 11:39 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T15:39:31.651Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/business/trump-stock-security-incident-truth-social/index.html,"Shares of Donald Trump’s social media company are experiencing another bout of turbulence following the latest assassination attempt against the former president and face of Truth Social. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) initially climbed 5% in premarket trading early Monday in the wake of the Sunday security incident.But in late morning trading, the Truth Social owner’s share price was down 4%. The reaction on Wall Street represents a far more muted response compared to the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Trump at a Pennsylvania rally in July. After the former president emerged defiant from that shooting, Trump Media skyrocketed as much as 50% the next trading day before closing up by 31%. Experts have compared Trump Media to a meme stock because it tends to trade on sentiment and hype, not fundamentals. And even though it brings in little revenue, the conservative social media company continues to be valued in the billions of dollars. The former president himself set off the latest turbulence on Friday when he declared he won’t sell shares in the company. “No, I’m not selling. No, I love it,” Trump said at a press conference in response to a question from a reporter. Lock-up restrictions preventing Trump and other insiders from selling shares expire as soon as Thursday. That event has been hanging over the stock for weeks. Trump Media’s share price exploded higher on Trump’s comments, spiking as much as 30%. The surge was so great that Nasdaq halted trading in the stock twice. Trump Media finished the day up by 12%, its best performance in three weeks. Trump lashed out at Nasdaq over the trading halt, suggesting something nefarious was at play. Yet such trading pauses are common across the US stock market. They are required by federal regulators and designed to provide a cooling-off period for stocks experiencing rapid increases or decreases in price. Investors who bought Trump Media when it went public this March remain deeply in the red. The stock is down roughly 74% from its March 27 closing high of $66.22. Trump’s stake of 114.75 million shares is still worth about $2 billion, but that’s down from $6.2 billion as recently as May 9."
"Suspect in apparent assassination attempt of Trump charged, may have been lying in wait for nearly 12 hours | CNN Politics","Updated 12:42 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T13:36:01.825Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/trump-assassination-court-developments/index.html,"Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, may have been lying in wait for nearly 12 hours along the tree line at Trump’s golf club, authorities said in a criminal complaint on Monday. Routh, 58, was charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number during an initial appearance in federal court Monday morning. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter told CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors seek to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate the incident. Wearing dark prison scrubs, his feet and hands shackled, Routh nodded and answered “yes” to questions asked by Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe. McCabe found Routh could not afford his own attorney after Routh said he had “zero funds” in his own savings. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. A detention hearing has been set for September 23, and the arraignment is set for September 30. Routh will be held in jail while he awaits trial. The incident happened about 1:30 p.m. ET Sunday after a Secret Service agent noticed the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence between the 5th and 6th hole of Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, Florida, in a tree line near a heavily traveled road. Cell-phone data indicates Routh may have spent nearly 12 hours on Sunday near the area where he was spotted in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. An FBI agent said in an affidavit filed in court that during their initial investigation, authorities got phone records from T-Mobile that indicated Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the area” where he was first spotted by US Secret Service from around 1:59 a.m. ET Sunday until 1:31 p.m. ET, when a Secret Service agent saw his rifle poking out from a tree line. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. Along the fence line, authorities found a sniper’s nest which included a scoped rifle, a GoPro camera and backpacks with ceramic plates. “This whole set-up indicates a very high level of pre-planning,” former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told CNN. Bradshaw said a witness saw a man run from the bushes. A man was later detained in Martin County, about an hour drive from Trump’s golf club. Routh was driving his daughter’s car when he was later detained, according to a law enforcement source. A picture released by the Martin County Sheriff’s Office after he was detained showed him wearing a long-sleeved, salmon-colored shirt with his hands cuffed behind his back. Routh remained silent while being detained, local state attorney David Aronberg told CNN. Trump’s golf outing was not on his public schedule and it’s not yet clear how Routh allegedly knew where Trump would be at that moment. Aronberg said Routh will face federal, not state charges. He told MSNBC that Florida initially considered pursuing state charges, but stood down when federal agents took over the case. On social media, Routh was a staunch supporter of Ukraine who said he supported Trump in 2016 but later became disillusioned with the former president. He’s been frequently critical of Trump recently. Routh traveled to Ukraine following Russia’s invasion two years ago, attending a rally in Kyiv on May 1, 2022. Representatives for Ukraine’s foreign legion said Routh contacted them several times but distanced themselves from Routh. Oleksandr Shaguri, an officer of the Foreigners Coordination Department of the Land Forces Command, told CNN over the phone that “the best way to describe his messages is – delusional ideas.” Routh’s son Oran Routh called him a “good father, and a great man” in a statement on Sunday. Aronberg told MSNBC there may be grounds to charge Routh with being in possession of a firearm as an ex-felon and aggravated assault against a federal law enforcement officer for pointing the rifle at the Secret Service agent. However, it may be difficult to charge Routh with a crime against Trump specifically. Aronberg said the distance between Routh and Trump, between 300 to 500 yards, might be too far for the court to be certain Routh was aiming his rifle at Trump. Instead, Aronberg said it will be much easier to charge Routh with aiming at the Secret Service agent who saw the rifle barrel pointed at him. “That’s the key witness here and that would be, perhaps, the most serious charge,” Aronberg said. When asked about the possibility of an insanity argument, Aronberg said it will be very difficult to argue because Routh fled the scene, which showed he was aware his actions were wrong. “You can explain it as the fact this guy’s got a screw loose,” Aronberg said, “(but that) doesn’t mean he’s legally insane under the law, that’s a higher burden.” President Joe Biden wants Congress to give the US Secret Service “more help” in the wake of Sunday’s incident. “Thank God the president is OK,” Biden told reporters Monday morning. He said he thought there was a “full report so far.” “The one thing I want to make clear is (the Secret Service) needs more help, and I think the Congress should respond to their needs if they, in fact, need more Service people,” Biden said at the White House, shortly before leaving for Delaware and Pennsylvania. “So that’s what we’re going to be talking about.” Asked by CNN’s Kevin Liptak what kind of help they needed, Biden responded, “I think we need some more personnel.” “I think they may need – they’re deciding whether they need more personnel or not,” Biden said. Staffing issues have plagued the Secret Service for years. Agents and officers have described feeling burned out by overtime shifts and long assignments, leading to high turnover. Then-USSS Director Kim Cheatle told Congress over the summer that the agency currently has 8,000 employees but that its goal was to reach 9,500. On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris said, “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence.” “I am thankful that former President Trump is safe,” she added. Coming 51 days before the election, the apparent attempt on the former president’s life is the latest escalation in what has been an extremely bitter political campaign — including another assassination attempt that wounded Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 and a separate Iranian plot against Trump that was foiled earlier this year. It left Biden and Harris once again having to decry political violence. Biden was briefed about the attempt on Trump’s life shortly after it was foiled and released a statement saying he was “relieved” Trump was unharmed and that “there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country.” Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Trump sought to blame Biden and Harris for the apparent attempt on his life, saying “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at.” “He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital of Routh. Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden kicked off his 2024 campaign that he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power.” Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.” Trump frequently uses inflammatory rhetoric when attacking his political rivals, judges overseeing his criminal cases, prosecutors who have brought charges against him, undocumented immigrants, people who don’t support his campaign and others. Trump has vowed retribution if he is reelected and has repeatedly suggested he would weaponize the justice system to prosecute his political opponents. Trump also recently threatened prosecution and “long-term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election. Harris is scheduled to attend a campaign meeting in Washington Monday afternoon, according to guidance from her campaign office. CNN previously reported Harris would also attend a rank-and-file roundtable with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington on Monday. Trump will appear at the launch for a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago home Monday evening. This story has been updated with additional developments."
Elon Musk deletes post questioning the Trump assassination attempt | CNN Business,"Updated 11:10 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T13:22:41.693Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/tech/elon-musk-biden-trump-assassination-attempt/index.html,"Elon Musk deleted a post Monday morning that questioned why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. Musk later claimed the post was a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. Musk initially resisted numerous calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But Musk was ultimately persuaded by an X post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. “Fair enough. I don’t want to do what they have done, even in jest,” Musk responded. He later posted several times that the deleted post had been a joke. However, Musk subsequently responded to a similar post, replying with a thinking face emoji to a photo that noted the four presidents who preceded Trump faced no assassination attempts when Trump has apparently encountered two. X did not respond to a request for comment. The White House called Musk’s comments “irresponsible.” “As President Biden and Vice President Harris said after yesterday’s disturbing news, ‘there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country,’ and ‘we all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,’” said White House spokesperson Andrew Bates in a statement. “Violence should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about.” CNN requested comment from the Secret Service, which is tasked with investigating perceived threats against the president and vice president – sometimes even if they are made in jest. The Secret Service in 2021 investigated a joke comedian John Mulaney made on “Saturday Night Live” comparing Trump to Julius Cesar, who was assassinated. It’s unclear if Musk, who owns X, violated X’s terms of service with those posts. He has routinely flouted his platform’s rules with few consequences. X said it restricts “engaging in or promoting violent acts,” although Musk denied he was calling for violence. Musk endorsed Trump for president after an assassination attempt in July, and he hosted Trump last month in an interview on X. It’s part of a rightward shift for Musk that has gained steam in recent years. Musk, the richest person in the world,  decries what he calls progressives’ “woke mind virus.” And he has warned of America’s impending “doom” if Democrats maintain control of the White House. But Musk’s posts aren’t just run-of-the-mill political chatter. He has increasingly engaged in conspiracy theories, including the false claim that the Biden administration allows undocumented immigrants to vote in US elections. He has also pushed the boundaries – or blown right past them – by posting fake images and using bigoted language in support of his causes. For example, Musk has posted numerous AI-generated images of Harris, including depicting her speaking before a crowd filled with communist imagery and symbols. And after Taylor Swift endorsed Harris for president that she signed “childless cat lady,” Musk responded with a widely criticized post: “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.” It’s the latest illustration of how few guardrails exist on the X platform."
"What we know about Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent second Trump assassination attempt | CNN","Updated 12:14 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T11:53:33.352Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/us/ryan-routh-trump-what-we-know-intl-hnk/index.html,"Ryan Wesley Routh put his enmity toward Donald Trump – the man he once supported but then dismissed as an “idiot,” a “buffoon” and a “fool” – at the center of a rambling and fanciful worldview that also fixated on Ukraine, Taiwan, North Korea, and what he called the “end of humanity.” The 58-year-old, who was detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on the former president, protested in Kyiv after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and committed his ideas to paper in a self-published 291-page book. Authorities suspect Routh, who owns a small construction company in Hawaii, was planning to attack the former President as he played a round of golf on Sunday, with US Secret Service agents firing at a man with a rifle in the bushes near the golf club. He was later apprehended after being stopped on a nearby highway. Routh appeared in federal court Monday and was charged with two counts, possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. For years, he criticized not only Trump but himself, describing Trump as “my choice” in the 2016 presidential election but later writing that he is “man enough to say that I misjudged and made a terrible mistake.” Here’s what we know about Routh so far. Routh’s thoughts and fixations on global politics appeared idealistic to some who came across him, but his writings show how he became increasingly militant about the geopolitical forces he railed against. His business pursuits, by contrast, appear relatively unremarkable. On Routh’s LinkedIn page, he said he started a company in 2018 called Camp Box Honolulu in Hawaii, which builds storage units and tiny houses. A story in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser said he donated a structure for homeless people. During his court appearance on Monday, Routh said he was making $3,000 a month before his arrest, had “zero funds” in savings and had no assets beyond two trucks in Hawaii. Routh also has ties to North Carolina, where public records show he registered as an “unaffiliated” voter without a party in 2012. He voted in that state’s Democratic primary in March of this year, according to public records. Records from the state dating back decades also show Routh has had previous scrapes with the law – including being arrested in 2002 after he was pulled over by police and allegedly put his hand on a firearm, and then drove off and barricaded himself in a business premises. He has also been involved in several court cases since the 1990s, with authorities repeatedly accusing him of failing to pay his taxes on time. Separately, judges have ordered him to pay tens of thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits. Routh became animated when writing about Trump, and he frequently weighed in on US and global current events on social media. In June 2020, Routh appeared to say that he had voted for Trump in 2016, but that he had since withdrawn his support of the former president. “I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment and it seems you are getting worse and devolving,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I will be glad when you gone.” Routh also mentioned Trump in his book, which appears on Amazon without a publisher listed, and is titled “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen-Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity.” In that publication, he described the former US president’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 as a “tremendous blunder” that drove Tehran closer to Moscow, which it then supplied with drones that have caused devastation across Ukraine. He even commented on the first assassination attempt on Trump, when the former president was wounded by a gunshot during a rally in Pennsylvania in July. Routh encouraged President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to visit those wounded in the incident, saying: “Trump will never do anything.” Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s 2022 invasion also became central to Routh’s philosophy; he expressed support for Ukraine in dozens of X posts that year, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.” He also visited Ukraine in 2022, according to video and photos geolocated by CNN and interviews he gave to international media during his time there. In a flurry of Facebook posts last year, he tried to enlist Afghan conscripts to fight in the war, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government. A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion confirmed with CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but said he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Oleksandr Shaguri, an officer of the Foreigners Coordination Department of the Land Forces Command, told CNN over the phone that “the best way to describe his messages is – delusional ideas.” “He was offering us large numbers of recruits from different countries but it was obvious to us his offers were not realistic. We didn’t even answer, there was nothing to answer to. He was never part of the Legion and didn’t cooperate with us in any way.” Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June 2022, where the American was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. “For me, it’s a surprise because I viewed him as an idealistic innocent genuine person, without any murderous instinct,” Cernea told CNN following news of Routh’s detention in the United States. According to Cernea, Routh described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “black and white… good versus evil” conflict. In an interview with AFP news agency from Kyiv in April 2022, Routh said: “Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the globe to stop what they’re doing and come here now and support the Ukrainians to end this war.” He also weighed in on the political situations in Afghanistan, Taiwan and North Korea in his book. Routh has repeatedly voiced support for Taiwan and previously called for international intervention to protect the island against potential Chinese encroachment. Routh’s eldest son, Oran, told CNN via text that Routh was “a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man.” “I don’t know what’s happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I’ve heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent,” Oran wrote. But other people have shared testimonies of tense interactions with Routh. Hawaiian business owner Saili Levi told CNN he had paid Routh $3,800 up front to build a trailer for his business. But when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy, he said. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. “I kind of decided maybe I should just let it go for the sake of my family,” Levi recalled.

Routh, the suspect of an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday, was charged Monday with possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number and possession of a firearm while a convicted felon.   The constitutionality of the federal law underpinning the second charge has been examined by federal courts around the country in recent years after some people convicted under it or subject to its prohibition have tried to take it off the books.   Courts have been divided on whether it is constitutionally sound. In one case, a Philadelphia-based federal appeals court that had initially said the law was constitutional as applied to a man convicted of welfare fraud said that the federal law violates the Second Amendment. It cited the 2022 Supreme Court decision, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, that said firearm laws must be rooted in historical tradition. But other federal courts have upheld the prohibition, including in cases concerning people convicted of violent and non-violent felonies.   The Supreme Court was asked this year to settle the question for good, with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar saying in court papers that disagreement among lower courts about the law’s constitutionality “is undermining public safety.”  This June, the Supreme Court said that some types of regulations can withstand the strict test it created two years ago. The Supreme Court has now asked lower courts to look at cases involving the felon disarmament law with that revised structure in mind. When there were rumors of a plot against the life of Abraham Lincoln before his 1861 inauguration, there was no official protection for the president-elect. Southern states were seceding from the Union in protest of Lincoln’s election, and the rumored plot out of Baltimore led Lincoln, at the urging of the private detective Allan Pinkerton, to sneak into Washington, DC, disguised on a late-night train. During his presidency, Lincoln eschewed bodyguards despite threats. The night Lincoln was shot at Ford’s Theatre the following year, his lone guard was at a saloon next door. But incredibly, it was on the day Lincoln was shot that the president had signed legislation creating what is today the US Secret Service. However, the agency was commissioned within the Treasury Department, and the Secret Service was entirely focused on counterfeit money. The Secret Service didn’t start protecting presidents until 1894, and only part time, after agents probing a group of gamblers discovered an assassination plot aimed at then-President Grover Cleveland. Two more presidents — James Garfield in 1881 and William McKinley in 1901 — would be killed before Congress officially tasked the Secret Service with protecting US presidents full time. McKinley’s successor, Theodore Roosevelt, was the first president to get round-the-clock protection, but only two agents were assigned full time to the detail. What was once just two full-time agents assigned to protect Roosevelt in 1902 has now grown to a force of thousands under the Department of Homeland Security. The entire Secret Service employs nearly 8,000 people, and it secures thousands of events each year. In fiscal year 2023, it guarded 33 “protectees.” Read more here President Joe Biden decried Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and condemned political violence in remarks from Philadelphia on Monday. Biden, speaking at the National HBCU Week Conference, commended the Secret Service for its “expert handling” of the situation and said the acting head of the agency, Ronald Rowe, is in Florida “determining whether any further adjustments need to be made to ensure the safety of our former president.” The president added that assassination “solves nothing. It just tears the country apart. We must do everything we can to prevent it and never give it any oxygen.” Attorney General Merrick Garland promised in a Monday statement to use “every available resource” in the investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump. Garland said that “the FBI is continuing to investigate what appears to be an assassination attempt of former President Trump” and that “we are grateful that the former President is safe.” Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, has an extensive criminal history in North Carolina, records show.  In 2002, he was charged with and later pleaded guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges, including resisting an officer, carrying a concealed weapon and ID card fraud.  Those are the most serious charges he faced, but the records also show a litany of less serious accusations as well — some of which were dismissed. He has faced multiple charges related to worthless checks in separate cases. While some cases were dismissed, he pleaded guilty to one such charge in 2003.  In 2009, he was charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. The case was dismissed.  In 2010, he was found guilty of misdemeanor possession of stolen goods and received three years of probation. That same year, he was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, though a court docket states the case was dismissed.  He has faced various other charges related to traffic issues. For example, in 1996, he pleaded guilty to driving with no registration. Separately, state and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. He faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records. The Pennsylvania State Police provided the bipartisan congressional task force investigating the July assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump with the documents it requested due Monday, a source familiar with the process told CNN.  “They were responsive to our request,” the source added.  The request included a slew of documents and information from the Pennsylvania State Police, including transcripts of interviews, body-camera footage and radio communications.   The task force also requested internal communications and other information related to the July 13 event in Butler, Pennsylvania. Some background: The task force, made up of six Democrats and seven Republicans, was approved by the House in July in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, but the appointment came at a fraught political time as members work to prove to both parties that they’re thoroughly investigating the attempted assassination. The 13 lawmakers have until mid-December to issue a final report and recommendations in the investigation. Members of the task force promised last month to get to the bottom of the security failures even if it may be a “slow process,” after the group toured the Pennsylvania rally site where the shooting took place. The FBI is investigating what it said is an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump at his Florida golf club Sunday, the second time in two months there has been an apparent attempt on the former president’s life. Trump is safe and was not harmed in the incident, his campaign said. Federal and local law enforcement are expected to provide updates on the investigation at a news briefing later today. Here’s where things stand now: Former President Donald Trump on Monday continued to try to blame Vice President Kamala Harris’ rhetoric for the apparent assassination attempt at his golf club on Sunday. In a new post on social media, the former president pointed to Harris’ statements during the ABC presidential debate, without specifying which ones.  “The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe’s, then Kamala’s, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust. Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Trump has repeatedly claimed the debate last week was “rigged” against him and has bashed the debate moderators and said he will not participate in another debate before the election. He also continues to baselessly claim that the criminal charges he faces and his felony conviction were masterminded by President Joe Biden and Harris because Trump is running for president.  In his first interview after the apparent assassination attempt in West Palm Beach posted earlier on Monday, Trump also sought to blame Biden and Harris for the apparent attempt on his life and argued in his first interview since the incident that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.”   Authorities recovered an SKS-style rifle with a scope from the area Ryan Wesley Routh fled Sunday after he was spotted by a Secret Service agent, according to newly unsealed court documents.  An affidavit from Mark A. Thomas, an FBI special agent, said Secret Service agents recovered a “loaded SKS-style 7.62x39 caliber rifle with a scope,” as well as a digital camera and two bags, including a backpack. The affidavit included a black-and-white photo of the items law enforcement found. Routh was charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.  He could face years in prison if convicted of the two charges, according to court documents. The felon in possession of a firearm charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and three years of supervised release, while the possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number carries a maximum of five years in prison and three years of supervised release. Officials from the Secret Service, the FBI and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office will hold a public briefing at 4 p.m. ET to provide updates on the investigation into Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. The briefing will take place near the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump tried to bring people over to fight in Ukraine via non-official means, against the advice of the International Legion in the country, and had “delusions of grandeur,” according to a former recruiter for the military unit. Evelyn Aschenbrenner, an American citizen who served for two years in the International Legion in Ukraine, a military unit of the Ukrainian Ground Forces that is composed of foreign volunteers, told CNN they warned Ryan Wesley Routh several times to use official routes to recruit people to fight in Ukraine and bring them across the border — but he just wouldn’t listen. Aschenbrenner, who identifies as gender fluid and uses “they/them” pronouns, worked as an administrator and then in an official recruiting role within the International Legion. “In August 2022, Routh put my phone number and another recruiter’s phone number on a website that he had designed. I got angry. I told him, ‘Take this down. You didn’t get our permission. The legion already has a recruiting website, there’s no need for you to be doing this. There’s already enough disinformation about Ukraine. Don’t start adding to it,’” Aschenbrenner said. Instead, Routh kept trying to bring people over the border into Ukraine, Aschenbrenner said. “In August 2022, for Ukraine’s Independence Day, there was a high security risk, with curfews in place in Kharkiv and other cities. And Routh messaged me asking to get some random person over the border and he sent me this poor woman’s passport,” they said. Aschenbrenner replied to Routh, saying they had no authority to bring people over, and highlighted the strike alert all over the country. “It’s a military. There’s a chain of command,” Aschenbrenner said they told Routh. “You need to be okay with possible delays. It’s an active war zone.” But Aschenbrenner said Routh got mad about that and replied to them in a message, which was seen by CNN: “I’ll tell the world Ukraine does not want help…it is obvious.” Aschenbrenner said they never saw Routh in Ukraine, neither in a combat zone nor in a military base.  “He seemed to have this delusion of grandeur thing, where he was the … I’ve seen this with some other volunteers on smaller scales … they’re the only one really helping Ukraine,” Aschenbrenner said. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office released bodycam video of the apprehension of Ryan Wesley Routh on Sunday on an interstate in Florida. Routh, who is suspected of planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf on Sunday, was stopped on the highway after authorities say a Secret Service agent engaged a suspect near Trump’s golf club after noticing the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. Bradshaw said a witness saw a man run from the bushes. Routh was later detained in Martin County, about an hour drive from Trump’s golf club. See video of the moment: CNN’s Evan Perez, Holmes Lybrand, Michael Williams and Devan Cole contributed reporting to this post. In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number on the rifle recovered from the area where Ryan Wesley Routh was spotted at Trump’s golf club was “unreadable to the naked eye.”   One of the charges Routh is facing has to do with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number — meaning that when law enforcement recovered the weapon Sunday, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump, made his initial court appearance Monday morning at a federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida. Court sketches show Routh standing before the judge. Ryan Wesley Routh’s cell phone data indicates he may have spent nearly 12 hours on Sunday near the area where he was spotted in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. An FBI agent said in affidavit filed in court that during their initial investigation, law enforcement got phone records from T-Mobile that indicated Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the area” where he was first spotted by US Secret Service from around 1:59 am local time Sunday until 1:31 pm local time, when a USSS agent saw his rifle poking out from a tree line. The court document also details Routh’s past run-ins with the law, including felony convictions in North Carolina. He was convicted in 2002 for “possession of a weapon of mass death and destruction,” and he was convicted in 2010 for “multiple counts of possession of stolen goods.” Federal law prohibits individuals convicted of a felony from possessing firearms. The arrest of the Trump attempted assassination suspect Sunday was a “textbook case of a traffic stop of a known felon,” Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said Monday at a news conference. At about 1:55 p.m. Sunday, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office got a BOLO – or “be on the lookout” alert – about a suspect in the case heading north on I-95, with a vehicle description and a tag number. Every available unit – about 30 in all, he estimated – went out to search. One patrol deputy saw the suspect vehicle at about Mile Marker 110 and alerted others but did not immediately try to stop the vehicle, Snyder said. Instead, the deputy waited for two large F-250 pickup trucks to get in place on the highway. Those trucks surrounded the vehicle, he continued, and forced it to a stop at about Mile Marker 112. Officers then did a “felony stop,” calling the suspect out of the vehicle. He came back and was handcuffed, the sheriff said. They turned the suspect and his vehicle over to the FBI. Snyder praised his team for following procedures designed to avoid a high-speed chase or a shootout. The sheriff also praised the witness who told authorities he had seen a suspect flee the golf course and get into a Nissan. “That witness deserves a lot of credit,” Snyder said. A criminal complaint against Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, was unsealed shortly before noon ET Monday after he made his initial court appearance where federal prosecutors charged him with gun-related charges.  An affidavit in the court file details what unfolded Sunday at Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida where a US Secret Service agent thwarted an apparent assassination attempt. Read the full criminal complaint below: Former President Donald Trump is still planning on attending his previously scheduled campaign events this week following the apparent assassination attempt, two sources familiar with the schedule tell CNN. The schedule: Trump’s virtual address on cryptocurrency on Monday evening will continue as planned. Trump is expected be in Flint, Michigan, tomorrow, Uniondale, New York, on Wednesday and Washington, DC, this week. One of the charges Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, is facing involves possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. That means when law enforcement recovered Routh’s weapon, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. It’s a common charge you see with drug and gang suspects. Most times people don’t manage to obliterate the serial numbers in every place it is imprinted on the gun. They can do the ones readily visible but not others in harder-to-reach places.  In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number was “unreadable to the naked eye.”  So far, Routh has been charged with two firearm counts. Dave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach, Florida, said Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, will face federal, not state charges.  Aronberg told MSNBC that Florida initially considered pursuing state charges, but stood down when federal agents took over the case. It may be difficult to charge Routh with a crime against Trump specifically. Aronberg said the distance between Routh and Trump, between 300 to 500 yards, might be too far for the court to be certain Routh was aiming his rifle at Trump. Instead, Aronberg said it will be much easier to charge Routh with aiming at the Secret Service agent who saw the rifle barrel pointed at him. When asked about the possibility of an insanity argument, Aronberg said it would be very difficult to argue insanity in this case because Routh fled the scene, showing he was aware his actions were wrong. Aronberg told MSNBC the evidence left behind including the two bags, ceramic tiles, GoPro, AK-14 rifle and scope will be key in making the case against Routh for attempted murder. The 2024 presidential election is less than 50 days away and the campaigns and their allies are continuing to blitz battleground states with tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advertising, Pennsylvania looming largest. Since July 22, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out to September 16, the top seven battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada — have seen $688.7 million in combined presidential advertising. During that stretch, Democrats lead Republicans — including campaigns and outside groups — by about $369.3 million to $315.3 million. Here are the latest numbers by broken down by state:  Pennsylvania Michigan Georgia Wisconsin Arizona North Carolina Nevada Pennsylvania remains the premier battleground, accounting for about $185.3 million in total ad spending since Biden dropped out, and Democrats are beginning to open a meaningful edge there after weeks in which the parties have been running close. As of today, Democrats have spent about $100 million on presidential ads in Pennsylvania, compared to about $84.3 million for Republicans. Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to blame President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the apparent attempt on his life at his Florida golf club. During an interview with Fox News Digital the former president said that the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.” Trump added, “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.”   The former president pointed to comments made by Biden and Harris that Trump is a threat to democracy, according to Fox News Digital, and said, “These are people that want to destroy our country.”   He said that Biden and Harris, “They are the real threat.” “They use highly inflammatory language,” Trump said. “I can use it too — far better than they can — but I don’t,” Trump said. Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden kicked off his 2024 campaign which he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power.” Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.” Trump frequently uses inflammatory rhetoric when attacking his political rivals, judges overseeing his criminal cases, prosecutors who have brought charges against him, undocumented immigrants, people who don’t support his campaign and others. Trump has vowed retribution if he is reelected and has repeatedly suggested he would weaponize the justice system to prosecute his political opponents. Trump also recently threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Donald Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought against Ryan Wesley Routh, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors are seeking to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate what the FBI has said appears to be an attempted assassination. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he has not yet spoken with former President Donald Trump after what appeared to be an attempted assassination on him as he played golf on Sunday, but reiterated that his state was doing its own investigation as “there is a need to make sure that the truth about all of this comes out in a way that is credible.” While taking questions, DeSantis explained his reasoning for why Florida was doing its own, separate investigation to the federal one. DeSantis said more details about the investigation would be announced in the coming days. He first announced the investigation on Sunday on X. DeSantis made the comments at a news conference in Orlando, Florida, where he appeared alongside education leaders in the state. During Monday’s hearing in federal court in Florida, Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect behind the apparent assassination attempt, answered the judge’s questions with nods and “yes judge” responses. The judge found Routh couldn’t afford his own attorney after he said he had “zero funds” in savings. He was making $3,000 a month before his arrest, Routh told the judge, but had no assets beyond two trucks in Hawaii. Prosecutor Adam McMichael said they would be asking for pre-trial detention, citing a risk of flight and danger to the community. Authorities suspect Routh, who owns a small construction company in Hawaii, was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf on Sunday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man suspected in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, has been charged with two firearm counts. The counts include possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.   A detention hearing has been set for September 23 and the arraignment is set for September 30. The White House weighed in on the now-deleted post from Elon Musk, calling the comment “irresponsible” and saying violence should be “never encouraged or joked about.” Musk deleted a post Monday morning questioning why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. Musk later claimed the post was a joke. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is holding a news conference in Orlando, Florida, a day after an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. DeSantis, who is speaking at an elementary school, addressed tertiary education across Florida and did not mention the incident involving Trump. Yesterday, the Florida governor announced on X that his state will conduct its own investigation of the incident. The apparent assassination attempt took place at Trump International Golf Club, which is located in West Palm Beach. CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed to this report. Kamala Harris’ campaign does not plan to address the weekend’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in a political manner, sources said, and any forthcoming remarks from the vice president on the developments are expected to closely mirror her statement released by the White House Sunday night. Both President Joe Biden and Harris were briefed on the incident in West Palm Beach, and both were quick to condemn all kinds of political violence and express relief that the former president was not harmed. Harris said in a statement — released in her official capacity as vice president via the White House — that she was “deeply disturbed” by the apparent assassination attempt. “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said. “I am thankful that former President Trump is safe.” Harris is participating in a meeting with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, this afternoon. She is also spending part of the day preparing for an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump,  is in federal court for an initial appearance Monday morning. Routh is wearing dark prison scrubs, and his feet and hands are shackled. He has been escorted to a holding area to await his appearance. Federal prosecutors have not yet announced what charges Routh will face. He was taken into custody Sunday after being stopped on the highway following the shooting incident. Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe is on the bench. Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe plans to remain in Florida “indefinitely” as the investigation into an apparent second assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump plays out, according to USSS spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.  Rowe will also meet with local law enforcement today and then do a walk through of the golf course this afternoon, Guglielmi told CNN on Monday.  He was appointed to the position on July 23, after Kimberly Cheatle resigned after Trump was shot in the ear in an attempted assassination. Trump and Rowe will meet today in Florida this afternoon, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this post. The man detained in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was so calm when he was stopped it was “perplexing,” the sheriff of Martin County, Florida, recalled.  “His facial affect was so flat. His demeanor was relaxed,” Sheriff William Snyder told CNN on Monday morning. “I honestly thought it looked like somebody that had just left the church picnic and was on his way home.” Despite the commotion surrounding his apprehension – the area “crawling with law enforcement … SWAT team (that) had gotten out their rifles, helicopter, I-95 shut down, a bomb dog” – the man never even asked why he got pulled over, Snyder said. The traffic stop unfolded after the sheriff’s office got a BOLO – a “be on the lookout” alert – with a vehicle and tag description, Snyder said. A road patrol deputy spotted the vehicle, followed it for a couple miles and waited for big trucks with heavy bumpers to get there and force the vehicle to a stop, he said. Deputies then conducted a felony stop and safely brought the man out of the vehicle into custody, Snyder said. Ryan Wesley Routh is appearing in federal court Monday morning. Now, Snyder’s main concern is to investigate whether anyone else was involved, he said. “Are we tracking with a conspiracy?” he asked. “That’s the question that I think has to be answered.” As the investigation over the apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump continues, the 2024 presidential candidates are hitting the campaign trail this week to make their pitch to voters in the final sprint to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting key swing states this week, while Trump is holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Monday: Trump will introduce a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will deliver remarks at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual dinner. Harris, meanwhile, will attend a roundtable with the Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, as she seeks to win over support from organized labor. Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, while Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. President Joe Biden wants Congress to give the US Secret Service “more help” in the wake of the second apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, he told reporters Monday.  “Thank God the president is okay,” Biden said. Asked by CNN’s Kevin Liptak what kind of help they needed, Biden responded, “I think we need some more personnel.” Staffing issues have plagued the Secret Service for years. Agents and officers have described feeling burned out by overtime shifts and long assignments, leading to high turnover. Then-director Kim Cheatle told Congress over the summer that the agency currently has 8,000 employees but that its goal was to reach 9,500. The Secret Service faced significant scrutiny following the first assassination attempt against Trump when he was struck in the ear during a rally in July. Elon Musk deleted a post Monday morning that questioned why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. He later claimed the post was a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. Musk initially resisted numerous calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But Musk was ultimately persuaded by an X post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. “Fair enough. I don’t want to do what they have done, even in jest,” Musk responded. He later posted several times that the deleted post had been a joke. There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided the tragedy of seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speak to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: that those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. Read more about the impact the assassination could have here. Ryan Wesley Routh, the detained man behind Donald Trump’s second apparent assassination attempt, was a small business owner in Hawaii and avid supporter of the Ukrainian war effort. CNN spoke to another Hawaiian business owner and a journalist in Ukraine, both of whom had interacted with Routh in the past. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June 2022, where the American was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. According to Cernea, Routh described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “black and white… good versus evil” conflict. In an interview with the AFP news agency from Kyiv in April 2022, Routh said: “Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the globe to stop what they’re doing and come here now and support the Ukrainians to end this war.” In another instance, Hawaiian business owner Saili Levi told CNN he had paid Routh $3,800 upfront to build a trailer for his business. But when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy, he said. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man detained Sunday in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, was driving his daughter’s car when he was apprehended, according to a law enforcement source. Routh was detained after the Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence and agents fired at a man who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. He then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The person detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt Sunday on former President Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course did not fire any shots, the Palm Beach County sheriff said Monday morning. The man is detained at a “federal holding facility,” Bradshaw added. Asked whether he is talking, Bradshaw responded: “No.” Bradshaw also praised the quick action of the Secret Service for keeping the former president safe. “This is not like what happened in Butler,” he said, referring to the assassination attempt against Trump two months ago in Pennsylvania that sparked scrutiny of the Secret Service. A photo of the moment 58-year-old Ryan Routh was detained by police in Florida, after allegedly being caught with a rifle on a golf course where former President Donald Trump was playing has been released. The Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence on Sunday and agents fired at Routh, who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. It is believed he then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office shared the image with CNN on Monday. Golf courses, and in particular former President Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds, according to people familiar with the matter. While security around Trump was bolstered in the aftermath of the first attempt on his life over the summer, the new beefed-up protective detail wasn’t able to prevent another would-be assassin from coming within 500 yards of the former president, armed with an AK-47 with a telescopic sight on Sunday. In some ways, a similar issue led to both situations: difficulty securing a perimeter around the former president. A golf course presents a particular challenge. The fairways and greens of a golf course are often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements such as trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the former president as he plays and secures the areas before he arrives. Read the full story. Ryan Routh attended a demonstration in support of a Ukrainian National Guard brigade in Kyiv in 2022, according to images verified by CNN. But in an official statement, the 12th National Guard Azov Brigade told CNN: “He has nothing to do with our brigade.” Other Ukrainian military groupings have issued similar statements saying Routh was not involved with them despite him expressing interest in aiding Ukraine.  A representative from Ukraine’s Land Forces Command foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted it several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. The Ukrainian military’s International Legion of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, another foreign legion organization, also said Routh had “never served” and “has no relation to the unit.” Ryan Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf, was a staunch supporter of Ukraine and had visited the country. Routh’s time in Ukraine: In an April 2022 video by AFP in Kyiv, Routh called Putin a “terrorist” and said “he needs to be ended.” A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Routh also expressed support for Ukraine on social media. In dozens of posts on X in 2022, he said he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”  He used Facebook to encourage foreigners to fight in the war, trying to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government.   The FBI said it “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, just two months after an attempt to kill the Republican presidential nominee at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president was not harmed. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii, has been detained in connection with Sunday’s incident, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what happened: Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company, has been detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what we know about him: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday that a Secret Service agent was able to spot a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and that the agent “engaged” with the suspect. The gunman was 300 to 500 yards away from former President Donald Trump, a Secret Service official said. The former president was one or two holes behind because the security detail moves ahead to make sure the area is cleared. The agent noticed the rifle barrel sticking out during the advance check, the official said. “The US Secret Service personnel opened fire on a gunman located near the property line and this matter is under investigation,” the Secret Service representative said. A witness saw the suspect later detained in the security incident near former President Donald Trump run from the bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s apprehension, according to the Palm Beach County sheriff. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Sunday that his office was alerted at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the US Secret Service. “We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Bradshaw said. Authorities were able to get a hit on the vehicle and alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the suspect. The witness was able to then identify the man Law enforcement officials found a weapon and other items left behind by the suspect where he was positioned in the bushes near the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. “In the bushes, where this guy was, is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope; two backpacks, which were hung on the fence and had ceramic tile in them; and a GoPro. … So, those are being processed right now,” Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said."
New York City Mayor Eric Adams’s administration is in chaos as federal probes target his inner circle | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:12 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T10:45:41.284Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/eric-adams-new-york-mayor-chief-counsel/index.html,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams’s administration is unraveling. Late Saturday night, the mayor abruptly announced the resignation of his top lawyer and most ardent public defender. Days earlier, his police commissioner stepped down under pressure as a quartet of federal probes targeting numerous members of Adams’s inner circle hits a boil. The stunning departure of chief counsel Lisa Zornberg, a former federal prosecutor, opened up a new and troubling chapter in the political and legal crisis now gripping City Hall. “I am tendering my resignation, effective today,” Zornberg wrote in a short letter, “as I have concluded that I can no longer effectively serve in my position.” Adams in a statement thanked her and said he would name a temporary replacement in the coming days. “These are hard jobs and we don’t expect anyone to stay in them forever,” Adams added in a bid to downplay the remarkable nature of Zornberg’s decision. By Monday, at least three Democratic officeholders – progressives from the state assembly, Senate and city council – had called on Adams to resign. The mayor rejected the notion in a call with reporters and suggested his critics, particularly those who have sparred with him before, were politically motivated. “Any time anything happens in this city, and they call for me to leave, are we supposed to listen to them now?” Adams said. “I was elected by the people of this city and I am going to continue to meet my obligation to the people of this city.” Adams has been fending off allegations that corruption and malfeasance permeate the highest ranks of his administration for months, first stemming from an active federal investigation into corruption and illegal campaign donations linked to Turkey and foreign travel, according to a source familiar with the matter. Adams is now entering an already fraught 2025 re-election bid under the cloud of at least four separate federal investigations – a political and legal onslaught that New York Democrats broadly expect to ramp up in the coming weeks and months. Adams has not been accused of any wrongdoing and the administration has said it will cooperate with all investigations. Brian Blais, a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, spoke to CNN about the potential problems Adams could face. “If campaign finance related charges are brought, or FARA (foreign agent registration act) charges relating to acting as an agent of the Turkish government, or bribery charges to the extent he was taking favorable actions in exchange for those campaign contributions, those are all serious charges, and those carry significant consequences,” said Blais.
“There’s at least some real degree of legal peril for the mayor.” The growing probes – underscored by increasingly aggressive tactics from prosecutors, who stopped Adams on the street last year to seize his phone – also signal mounting political trouble for the retired police captain who outlasted a crowded field of Democrats in 2021 on his way to winning the city’s top job. Even before he was elected, Adams embraced the national media spotlight, declaring himself the “face of the new Democratic Party” and, after being invited to the White House, described himself as “the Biden of Brooklyn.” But the luster quickly faded. First with Biden, after Adams publicly criticized the president’s handling of the border and a migrant crisis that hit hard in New York. The mayor’s reputation for enjoying the nightlife – at the expense, Adams’s critics say, of his day job – and repeated clashes over city spending, especially on education, dimmed his political star. Adams’s political troubles, though, have been magnified and multiplied by the federal probes, which are picking up pace as the 2024 political season heats up. Investigators in the Southern District of New York have been circling Adams and his administration for nearly a year. Last November, the mayor’s chief fundraiser was raided by FBI agents. Days later, Adams himself was presented with a federal search warrant for his electronics. That remarkable escalation by federal prosecutor Damian Williams was followed by a period of relative quiet until last week, when FBI officials issued search warrants and showed up at the homes of several Adams administration officials. The group included the city’s First Deputy Commissioner Sheena Wright, the Schools Chancellor David Banks and the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks III, according to multiple sources familiar with the probe. Investigators also issued a subpoena to Terence Banks, the youngest of the Banks’ brothers – who ran a lobbying firm that advertised “government relations” and promised to help private sector clients navigate “New York’s intricate infrastructure and political landscape.” Tim Pearson, a former NYPD officer and adviser to the mayor, was also included in the searches, sources briefed on the investigation say. None of the officials have been accused of any crime. Wright said in a briefing last week, “I’m confident that I have done nothing wrong,” and was “cooperating fully.” David Banks said in a statement he was “cooperating with a federal inquiry.” An attorney for Phil Banks said in a statement, “In my judgment I don’t believe he has any criminal liability in this investigation whatsoever.” An attorney for Terence Banks told CNN, “We have been assured by the Government that Mr. Banks is not a target of this investigation.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Pearson for further comment. US attorneys’ offices and the FBI have declined to comment. But the most shocking blow landed at One Police Plaza. NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, the leader of the largest and most expensive police force in the nation, had his phone seized along with several other police officials’ devices as part of an investigation into a nightclub security business run by his twin brother, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. He resigned under pressure days later, saying in a statement that “news around recent developments has created a distraction for our department.” Caban’s lawyers said on Thursday they’ve been informed he is not a target of any investigation and he expects to cooperate fully with the government. In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Adams’s top spokesperson touted the administration’s record on public safety and affordability, and suggested New Yorkers were not paying close attention to the investigations. “We are investing in the programs and initiatives that working-class New Yorkers care about – that’s what our city’s residents and our administration are focused on every day,” said Fabien Levy, the deputy mayor for communications. “No matter what is going on in our city, New Yorkers recognize that we are in a much better place today than we were 2.5 years ago.” While the spate of aggressive investigative maneuvers sent shockwaves through political and law enforcement circles, Adams has not been charged with any crime. That decision will ultimately come down to the discretion of Williams’s office, compounding the pressure on the prosecutor as he seeks to navigate a fraught moment – with the presidential election less than two months away. “If something is going to happen, if there are people in the mayor’s political orbit, or the mayor himself, who is going to be charged, I think that, in DOJ ‘s view, it likely needs to happen by March (2025),” said Blais, now a partner at the law firm Ropes and Gray. “So you’re talking about a six-to-seven month window left before any significant action is likely, or during which any significant action is likely to occur.” Other observers are predicting a shorter timeline at least in part because of the uncertainty surrounding this November’s election. Victory for former President Donald Trump, who would again take over the Justice Department, could upend Williams’s office. One former top aide to top prosecutors in New York told CNN that Williams, “a very thoughtful, considered guy,” is conscious of the stakes – both in this election cycle and the broader sweep of city history. “He’s aware of all the implications here,” the former aide said. “He’s aware that this is the second Black mayor. He’s aware that he’s a Black prosecutor. None of this is happening without that awareness, which to me makes it even more scary if I’m Eric Adams.” Williams on Monday, while announcing public corruption charges against two former fire department chiefs in what is believed to be an unrelated probe, demurred when asked what he would tell New Yorkers concerned over the City Hall investigations. “I am constrained on what I can say,” Williams told reporters. “I speak when there is something to be said and I don’t have anything to say about that at this point.” He did, however, offer a pointed message about his office’s work. “We are determined to address it from root to branch, and our work is far from done,” Williams said. “If you are aware of and participated in corrupt activity in our government, now is the time to come forward to get on the right side of the law.” For his part, the mayor has insisted that he never broke the law, nor knew of any of his friends and colleagues’ potential wrongdoing. During brief remarks to reporters after Caban stepped down, Adams insisted again that he was “surprised” by the breadth of probes and said he was taking “them extremely seriously.” “I’ve spent more than 20 years in law enforcement, and so every member of my administration knows my expectations that we must follow the law,” Adams said, repeating a variation on a message he’s given a handful of times now. This latest round of phone seizures and subpoenas have, as a political matter, all but guaranteed that Adams will face a robust set of Democratic primary challengers next year. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie of Brooklyn is expected to launch his bid soon. City Comptroller Brad Lander is already in, along with his predecessor, Scott Stringer, who also ran in 2021. Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, kicked off her campaign on Friday, less than a day after Caban resigned. Others, including state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani could still join the fray. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 with impeachment looming following the release of a report that found he sexually harassed 11 women, has also seeded rumors about a potential run. Cuomo has denied the allegations. Adams’s record as mayor, headlined by controversial budget cuts and what critics call a lack of a signature program or legislative achievement, always seemed bound to attract intra-party challengers. But the close-to-home nature of the federal probes appear – at least to some rival Democrats – to be a uniquely damaging development. “Crises are a problem when they bring up for an incumbent candidate things people were already feeling and double down on or amplify something that was already out there,” said Stringer adviser Alyssa Cass. Another veteran New York campaign strategist with experience in City Hall but no ties to this race and speaking anonymously because of the sensitive nature of the latest developments, warned that Adams’s challengers needed to carefully calibrate their messages. Their attacks, so far, have mostly focused on a perception of “chaos” in the administration and an argument that Adams is a weak manager. “Adams does not lose unless you start taking away some part of his coalition,” the strategist said. “And that is a working-class coalition. You don’t need to speak about who’s managing city operations, you need to talk about who’s getting you what you need, to (argue that) Adams has been compromised and is totally beholden to these shady special interests. And it’s hurting you.” As those political chips fall in place, other Democratic strategists and operatives say now is the time for Adams to focus on that base, with its backbone in Southeast Queens, and remind supporters why they voted for him in the first place. “Just because Caban resigned doesn’t mean that the problems are going to go away, even if he tries to cut ties with some of these folks,” Camille Rivera, a New York City-based political strategist, told CNN. “I would run a campaign now, I would be out there in the community, running my town halls, being in the districts, having conversations with my people and solidifying my base if I feel like I’ve done nothing wrong.” That message, though, has become increasingly tough to get across – and not only because of his Covid quarantine. In some of the most recent, in-depth polling, from December 2023, when he was only facing a probe into his campaign fundraising, Adams’s overall approval rating dropped to a staggering 28%, according to a Quinnipiac University survey. Hispanic voters, a critical part of his base, came in even lower at 20%. Among Black voters, Adams was still favored by 10 points, 48% to 38%, an advantage he cannot afford to forfeit. The mayor’s office lashed out over the poll, with a spokesman criticizing its methodology and pointing to falling crime – which has gone down in the city and nationally – and an improved economic outlook. Adams received a boost earlier in the summer when the Rev. Al Sharpton wrote an op-ed backing the mayor and suggesting that the opposition was racially-coded, recalling the defeat of the city’s first Black Mayor, David Dinkins, to Rudy Giuliani in 1993. “The criticism of Adams and the disconnect between perception and reality of his administration of this city is extreme,” Sharpton wrote. “Somehow it seems easier for those who are against him to get their message through, and for the damning, coded, curse of incompetence to be laid on his head.” Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, a Brooklyn Democratic leader and top ally, delivered a similar message last year, telling reporters she was “concerned about whether these investigations are just targeting him because he’s a Black mayor.” Adams has not directly embraced that narrative, but he has repeatedly cast himself as unduly persecuted – including referencing the Biblical Book of Job, the story of a righteous man whose faith is tested by a series of personal calamities. “I wish I could tell you that I had one moment in my life that was a Job moment. But I did not have one, I had many,” he said during a visit last Sunday to the Power and Authority Evangelical Ministry in East New York, another political stronghold. Adams is not the first mayor to find himself under investigation, but if prosecutors decide to bring charges, he could become the first New York mayor indicted in the modern era. Mayor Jimmy Walker resigned in 1932 while facing an investigation. More recently, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself in the crosshairs of investigators because of his fundraising practices before the US Attorney’s Office declined to bring charges against him. It’s still unclear when each of the Adams administration’s investigations began, but former Assistant US Attorney Jennifer Beidel says it’s possible that a phone seizure in one case could lead investigators onto another totally different case. “That’s one of the most dangerous things about having your electronic devices seized. We all have a lot of material on it,” said Beidel, now a government investigations attorney at the law firm Dykema. “So you don’t have much ability to limit where law enforcement takes that info after.” Despite the ongoing cases, Biedel told CNN it has become clear that federal law enforcement agencies are zeroed in on City Hall. “The goal in the public corruption unit is to focus their resources on conduct that is concerning,” she said. “They wouldn’t continue that apparent focus if they didn’t believe there was something there.” That reality, in legal but also political terms, is setting in among some of Adams’s closest allies and friends in the administration. “I had a number of FBI agents who came to my home and wanted my personal phone and my DOE phone, outside of that I don’t know a lot,” David Banks, the city schools chancellor, said on Friday, adding that federal agents have not yet returned his phones. “We will all wait and see where these investigations go.”"

The FBI is investigating an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at his Florida golf club on Sunday. Trump is safe and was not harmed in the incident, his campaign said. It comes just two months after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. Law enforcement sources on Sunday identified the person detained as a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii who frequently criticized Trump on social media. The man was detained shortly after the Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking through the fence of the golf course and agents fired at a man who was in the bushes along the perimeter. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris issued statements condemning political violence, adding that they will ensure that the Secret Service has all the resources necessary to protect the former president. The Primetime Emmy Awards, which honor the best in American television, were handed out Sunday in Los Angeles. It was a huge night for the historical epic “Shōgun,” which became the first ever non-English language series to win best drama, along with wins for lead actor, actress and directing. The comedy category saw big wins for the FX hit “The Bear,” including for star Jeremy Allen White. But it was “Hacks” — a women-led series about an aging stand-up and a young comedy writer — that took the outstanding comedy series prize. The Netflix show “Baby Reindeer” won the Emmy for outstanding limited series, anthology or TV movie. The show’s creator Richard Gadd won writing and acting Emmys, and supporting actress Jessica Gunning also took home a statuette for her performance. Here’s a list of all the winners. Some of the heaviest rain in decades hit parts of central and eastern Europe over the weekend, causing flooding and widespread disruptions. A low pressure system dubbed Storm Boris dumped months’ worth of rain onto several of Europe’s historic capitals, including Vienna, Bratislava and Prague. Red alerts, the highest-level warning, are still in effect for portions of Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia. At least eight people have died, authorities said. Meanwhile, Shanghai was brought to a standstill today by what China says is the city’s strongest storm in seven decades. Typhoon Bebinca made landfall in a suburb southeast of the metropolis with wind speeds of 80 mph, the equivalent of a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane. The Israeli military says that three Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza in December were “most likely” killed as a result of an Israeli airstrike. Recovering the hostages captured by Hamas on October 7 is one of the main goals of Israel’s campaign in Gaza as pressure builds to end the humanitarian crisis in the region. US officials are trying to get both sides to agree to a deal first laid out by President Biden in May. The three-phase proposal pairs the release of hostages with a “full and complete ceasefire.” Since then talks have stalled and both sides have pointed to what they see as glaring holes in the framework, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting that Israel’s forces will never leave the stretch along the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor. SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn all-civilian crew returned to Earth Sunday after a five-day mission to orbit that included the world’s first commercial spacewalk. The Crew Dragon capsule splashed down off the coast of Florida at 3:37 a.m. ET, concluding the high-risk event. The Polaris Dawn mission made history as it reached a higher altitude than any human has traveled in five decades. A spacewalk conducted on Thursday also marked the first time such an endeavor has been completed by a privately funded and operated mission. The crew’s apogee — or farthest point from Earth — made two crew members the first women ever to fly so far from our planet. Mid-Autumn Festival: Mooncakes, lanterns and so much more

Analysis: New apparent Trump assassination bid is another dark moment with unpredictable political consequences | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:44 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T04:00:19.798Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/political-consequences-trump-assassination-attempt-analysis/index.html,"There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided the tragedy of seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speak to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: that those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. In his most expansive reaction to what happened, Trump posted on his Truth Social network Sunday evening about what he described as “certainly an interesting day!” “I want to thank the U.S. Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated Patriots, and, all of Law Enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican Nominee in the upcoming Presidential Election, SAFE,” Trump wrote. “THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!” Vice President Kamala Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and President Joe Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” As crass as it may be to consider political ramifications in the immediate aftermath of an apparent assassination attempt, everything in America is politicized within minutes — especially with 50 days left until a close election. Trump — who within seconds of surviving his first, much closer assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, stood up and said, “fight, fight, fight” — quickly released a fundraising email on Sunday afternoon that read, “I am Safe and Well!” “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” Trump wrote in the email that linked to a site allowing supporters to donate. And one of the ex-president’s top allies, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, released a statement reprising the idea Trump was spared by divine providence, which was a recurrent theme at the Republican National Convention. The House GOP conference chair suggested that after what had happened, the country now had a duty to elect Trump. “Thankfully, God continues to watch over President Trump. As Americans we must unite behind him in November to protect our republic and bring peace back to the world,” she said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, after visiting the former president at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Sunday, also suggested that Trump had benefited from divine intervention and played into the narrative that Trump is unbeatable. “No leader (in) American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient. He is unstoppable.” That sense of Trump being protected by God animated his supporters’ feeling at the Milwaukee convention that he was destined for victory. Such assumptions were dampened, however, when Biden shelved his reelection bid, allowing Harris to jump in and transform the contest. The man detained in the apparent assassination attempt had been spotted by the Secret Service several holes ahead of the former president at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Stefanik asked how “an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again?” She wrote: “There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened today in Florida.” The New York Republican’s questioning of the Secret Service is likely to foreshadow debate in the coming days about the level of the former president’s protection — especially given what happened in Butler. Trump has already suggested, without evidence, that the Biden administration and Harris were complicit in the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania because he claims they weaponized the Justice Department against him. But all of Trump’s criminal problems have proceeded through regular order in the courts, and there is no evidence that the White House is in any way involved. The second apparent assassination attempt comes against the backdrop of a turbulent campaign that has defied convention and predictions. For the first time since 1968, a sitting president folded his reelection campaign within months of the election, reluctantly making way for his vice president, who has a chance to become the first Black woman and South Asian commander in chief. The Republican nominee is a convicted felon who is facing multiple criminal charges over his unprecedented attempt to stay in power after losing the last election. If he is returned to the White House, Trump would be only the second president who lost reelection to win a nonconsecutive second term. The ex-president’s actions in the coming days will be closely watched. After the first assassination attempt, the former president called on the country to come together. But his unity pledge didn’t last much longer than the first third of his speech at the Republican National Convention, which degenerated into the characteristic divisiveness on which he built his political career. Trump has also repeatedly ignored the advice of senior Republicans and his campaign team to stick to a sharp, concise argument against Harris. They’d like him to focus on her role in the Biden administration’s economic policy at a time when many voters are still struggling with high prices despite a lowering of the inflation rate. So even if his aides counsel him to renew his national unity theme, there’s no guarantee Trump will listen or consider it in his political interests. Another apparent attempt on his life is likely to have some level of personal impact on the former president. In the days after narrowly cheating death or serious injury in Pennsylvania when a bullet grazed his ear, Trump seemed chastened. But ever since, he has returned to his rambunctious self and, if anything, his rhetoric has become even more extreme. He’s recently been warning his political opponents that he will turn the law against them and lock them up if he considers the election fraudulent, and he has doubled down on his baseless claims that the last election was stolen. In the immediate aftermath of Sunday’s incident, the focus of most Trump opponents was on maintaining calm at a volatile moment. There can be no justification in a democracy for attempting to silence any political figure by violence. At the same time, however, in the coming days, there will be debate about the extent to which the former president — a uniquely inflammatory figure — has helped to stoke the nation’s divides. Earlier this weekend, for example, the ex-president and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had been heightening political tensions. Both Republicans have highlighted baseless claims that Haitian refugees in Springfield, Ohio, have been stealing and eating pets. Trump’s opponents have warned that his continued racial demagoguery is putting lives at risk. In a contentious interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Vance insisted that the claims about the Haitian migrants — who are in the United States legally — were validated by complaints from some of his constituents. And far from backing away from the story — despite testimony from multiple local officials that there’s no truth to the rumor — Vance angrily condemned suggestions that recent bomb threats against the city had anything to do with him and Trump escalating the claims. He told Dana Bash: “This town has suffered terribly under the problem — under the policies of Kamala Harris.” But Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, asked on ABC on Sunday whether he had seen any evidence of the pet-eating rumors, said, “No. Absolutely not.” The Ohio governor added that the Haitian migrants, whom Trump threatened on Friday to deport to Venezuela, were in the country legally. In normal circumstances, an apparent assassination attempt against a presidential candidate might be expected to unleash a surge of sympathy that could translate into a political boost. But the latest near-miss for Trump comes at a moment when the race with Harris is neck-and-neck. While both candidates are fighting over perhaps several hundred thousand movable voters in swing states, it’s not clear how much room remains for changing perceptions about Trump, who has been a polarizing figure ever since his 2015 launch of his first national campaign. The former president is all but certain to use the latest events to reinforce his baseless claim that he’s a victim of persecution meant to keep him from power. But it’s too early to say whether the second apparent assassination attempt will have greater political impact than the first. Ultimately, it’s going to be up to voters to sort out this unpredictable and dangerous campaign season."
Man detained in apparent assassination attempt on Trump criticized former president on social media | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:14 PM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-16T01:46:36.263Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/trump-attempted-assassination-man-detained/index.html,"A 58-year-old man detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida is a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii who went on social media to weigh in on politics and current events, at times criticizing the former president. Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf, posted comments on an X account linked to him referencing the assassination attempt on Trump at a July rally in Pennsylvania. Routh tagged Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, in separate posts, encouraging them to visit those injured at the rally. “You and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally and attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them,” he wrote in a post directed at Harris. In an April post on X tagging President Biden’s presidential account, he wrote that Biden’s campaign should be: “called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA …make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.” In June 2020, Routh appeared to say that he had voted for Trump in 2016, but that he had since withdrawn his support of the former president: “While you were my choice in 2106, I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment and it seems you are getting worse and devolving,” he wrote. “I will be glad when you gone.” Routh also has ties to North Carolina, where public records show he registered as an “unaffiliated” voter without a party in 2012. He voted in that state’s Democratic primary in March of this year, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. Routh has contributed more than $100 to ActBlue, which processes donations for Democrats, federal campaign finance records show. Routh expressed strong support for Ukraine – in dozens of posts on X in 2022, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.” “I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE…Can I be the example We must win,” Routh said in an X post in March 2022. Routh then used his personal Facebook account last year to encourage foreigners to fight in the war. He tried to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts, beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government. “Afghan Soldiers- Ukraine is somewhat interested in 3000 soldiers, so I need every soldier that has a passport to send me a copy of their passport to send to Ukraine,” he wrote in one such post, which was published in English and Pashto. Routh’s LinkedIn page says he started a company in 2018 called Camp Box Honolulu, which builds storage units and tiny houses; a story in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser said he donated a structure for homeless people. “Work has never been about money rather building frameworks for people to thrive and succeed,” Routh wrote on his LinkedIn page. “Being mechanically minded I enjoy ideas and invention and creative projects with artistic flare.” The company’s website says it uses standard economical, fast and efficient construction techniques and materials to “produce solutions to our own problems right here on the island.” A Hawaiian man who gave Routh a bad review on Facebook told CNN he was unsettled by Routh’s response to the criticism. Saili Levi, owner of a vanilla company, said he had paid Routh $3,800 up front to build a trailer for his business, but when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. “I kind of decided maybe I should just let it go for the sake of my family.” Records from North Carolina, dating back a couple of decades, also show that he had scrapes with the law. In 2002, Routh was arrested after he was pulled over by police and allegedly put his hand on a firearm before barricading himself in a business, according to a Greensboro News & Record article that year that cited police. A law enforcement confirmed the arrest to CNN on Sunday. Public records reveal several court cases involving Routh since the 1990s. State and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. For example, he faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records. In 1998, the state alleged he committed an offense related to a “worthless check,” though that case was dismissed. Separately, judges have ordered him to pay tens of thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits. Routh’s eldest son, Oran, told CNN via text that Routh was “a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man.” The son wrote, “I don’t know what’s happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I’ve heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent.”"
Golf courses — in particular Trump’s — have long proved a difficult assignment for Secret Service | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:00 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-15T23:02:19.451Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/trump-golf-course-security-challenges/index.html,"Golf courses, and in particular former President Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds while the commander in chief plays, according to people familiar with the matter. While security around Trump was bolstered in the aftermath of the first attempt on his life over the summer, the new beefed-up protective detail wasn’t able to prevent another would-be assassin from coming within 500 yards of the former president, armed with an AK-47 with a telescopic sight on Sunday. In some ways, a similar issue led to both situations: difficulty securing a perimeter around the former president. A golf course presents a particular challenge. The fairways and greens of a golf course are often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements such as trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Officials said at a news conference Sunday that a suspected would-be shooter hid in a patch of bushes on the perimeter of Trump’s golf course before a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of his weapon. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the former president as he plays and secure the areas in the several minutes before he arrives. Trump, like presidents before him, likes to drive his own golf cart — one of the only opportunities a sitting or former president has to drive any kind of vehicle. People familiar with the matter said the president’s golf cart is not equipped with any special protective measures, though it does have a presidential seal affixed to it. Sometimes, agents use metal detecting wands to screen players and other guests before they come into close proximity to the former president. And while there have been efforts in the past to restrict who can come near Trump while he’s at one of his clubs, he likes socializing with members. Trump International Golf Club, in West Palm Beach, abuts three heavily trafficked roads, Kirk Road, Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. The Palm Beach International Airport is nearby. As president, Trump could often be spotted from across from Kirk Road when he was playing golf. But members of the media were not permitted to stand on the sidewalks near the golf course when Trump was playing. After he left office, some of those restrictions were lifted. Members of the public were able to have a clear view of Trump from the sidewalks on Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. In a briefing Sunday, the Palm Beach County sheriff acknowledged some of the security concerns. “The level where he is at right now, he is not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had the entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, security is limited to the areas the Secret Service deems possible,” Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said. “I would imagine the next time (Trump) comes to the golf course, there would probably be a little more people around the perimeter,” Bradshaw added. When Barack Obama was president, his most frequent golf outing was to the links at Joint Base Andrews, which by its nature on a military installation had restricted access — both to the course itself and to its surroundings. President Joe Biden rarely golfs. This story has been updated with additional information."
The latest on the 76th Emmy Awards | CNN,No Results Found,2024-09-15T21:07:47.446Z,https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/live-news/emmy-awards-levy-09-15-24/index.html,"The Primetime Emmy Awards, which honor the best in American television, have just wrapped up tonight in Los Angeles. Eugene and Dan Levy, the father-and-son duo who co-starred in the sitcom “Schitt’s Creek,” hosted the show from the Peacock Theater. See some of the best photos from the night: Look back on more memorable moments here. From nostalgic TV reunions to “The Bear’s” Liza Colón-Zayas beating Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett to win outstanding supporting comedy actress, the night was all about reminding us how surprising and wonderful television was, is and can be. Bringing together famous television dads, moms, coaches, cops, doctors and lawyers by presenting actors who played them in iconic TV shows gave viewers the opportunity to reminisce about some of their favorite series and characters. Some of “The West Wing” cast came together toward the end of the night to the delight of the audience to present an award and to encourage everyone to vote in this year’s election. Earlier, Henry Winkler and Ron Howard appeared onstage to reminisce about the legendary series that made them household names, “Happy Days.” While things are pretty contentious these days, it was a joy to remember when simply picking which channel to watch was the most stressful part of TV. But all isn’t lost and there was also plenty to remind us that the industry is still churning out some pretty good work, even in the face of the ever-expanding crush of content. Jean Smart’s joke about believing the hit Netflix series “Baby Reindeer” was about Rudolph the red-nosed one was well-timed, providing the perfect setup for that show to win the Emmy for limited/anthology series, along with acting trophies for star and creator Richard Gadd and his costar Jessica Gunning. The dark drama is actually based on Gadd’s experience with a woman he said started as a friend and turned into a stalker. He had some words of wisdom in one of his acceptance speeches. Hopefully, Hollywood continues to take note regarding good storytelling, and leans into Gadd’s urging to “dare” and take risks. Ultimately, though, Emmys night kept coming back to the theme of representation and the constant need to do better. Colón-Zayas became the first Latina to ever win in her category, which was a good reminder that there are still some hills left to climb in Hollywood. “Shōgun” won top honors as outstanding drama show, becoming the first ever non-English language series to win the award. And “Hacks” was somewhat of a surprise winner in the outstanding comedy series category, placing a women-led series that deals with sexism and later-life career struggles in the spotlight. Encapsulating the energy of the night, John Leguizamo gave an impassioned speech paying tribute to the historic Latinx nominees and recognizing other minorities in the Emmy nominee pool, saying he was “one of Hollywood’s DEI hires,” going on to define DEI as “diligence, excellence and imagination.” “We are all DEI hires,” Leguizamo said. It was Rose family reunion on the Emmys stage Sunday evening when “Schitt’s Creek” stars Catherine O’Hara and Annie Murphy joined hosts Dan and Eugene Levy. Murphy, with the Levys, took to the stage at first, with Murphy joking that she heard they’d asked the “shining star of ‘Schitt’s Creek’” to present the final award. Dan Levy then broke the news to his onscreen sister that the person in question actually wasn’t her, and the three of them then introduced O’Hara to present the final award of the evening. O’Hara, who played Rose family matriarch and TV icon Moira Rose on “Schitt’s Creek,” joked that she was “shocked and delighted” to be presenting the award for best comedy series. After O’Hara jokingly tore up the winner’s envelope, crying out about why “must we really choose a winner,” she pulled out the actual winner’s envelope and announced that “Hacks” won the Emmy for best comedy. “Hacks” has won the Emmy for outstanding comedy series, earning the top award despite stiff competition from “The Bear.” Writer and co-creator Paul W. Downs thanked the cast, crew and writers of the show and made a case for more representation onscreen while accepting the award. The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. The third season of “Hacks” finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. Red carpet season is underway: The biggest names in television descended on LA’s Peacock Theater for the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards tonight.  Check out some of the most memorable looks from the night:  See all the best photos from the red carpet here. “Shōgun” has won the Emmy for outstanding drama series, making it the first ever non-English language series to do so. Hiroyuki Sanada, who won an Emmy for outstanding lead actor from the show, then gave his speech in Japanese, which Marks translated. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. About a week after its debut, Disney reported that the first episode garnered 9 million views globally across its streaming platforms Hulu+, Disney+ and Star+, making it the company’s top scripted general entertainment series premiere globally. CNN’s Christy Choi, Julia Chatterley and Lisa Respers France contributed to this post. Anna Sawai took home the Emmy award for outstanding lead actress in a drama series for her role as Lady Mariko in “Shōgun.” It’s her first Emmy win and nomination. While accepting her award, she thanked the Television Academy, her fellow nominees within the category, her family as well as her cast and crew. “This is to all the women who expect nothing and continue to be an example to everyone,” she said. “Shōgun,” the epic historical drama, is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. CNN’s Christy Choi and Julia Chatterley contributed reporting. Christine Baranksi, Viola Davis and Gina Torres appeared on stage to argue their case for why lawyers are among some of television’s favorite — and most astute — characters.  “The lawyer sees our witness,” Baranski — who played Diane Lockhart on “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” — said.  Davis, who portrayed professor of defense law Annalise Keating in “How to Get Away with Murder,” added one caveat: “Lawyers have seen every combination of the human condition and their efforts.” Torres added that in so many ways, lawyers work to “better the human condition.” The actress embodied Jessica Pearson in the legal drama series “Suits.” The trio appeared on stage to present the award for lead actress in a drama series. The Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a drama series goes to Hiroyuki Sanada. This is his first nomination and first Emmy win. “Shōgun” is notching some major victories tonight, and is one to watch later tonight. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, is only the second non-English language program to be nominated in the outstanding drama category. The series is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. CNN spoke with Sanada, who plays Lord Yoshii Toranaga, about how showrunners brought the series to life. CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this post. The dark Netflix hit “Baby Reindeer” took home the Primetime Emmy award on Sunday night for best limited or anthology series. He introduced and thanked the show’s cast and crew who was onstage alongside him. Gadd also went on to highlight the show’s willingness to take risks and encouraged other showrunners to do the same. “There’s no set formula to this,” he said, urging people to “take risks, push boundaries, explore the uncomfortable, dare to fail in order to achieve.” Jodie Foster, the two-time Oscar-winning actress, has won the first Emmy of her career. Foster was recognized as best lead actress in a limited series, anthology or TV movie for her work in “True Detective: Night Country.” “This is an incredibly emotional moment for me because ‘True Detective: North Country’ was just a magical experience,” Foster said. She thanked her “champ and my partner in crime” Kali Reis, her costar on the show.  Foster also highlighted the indigenous people of northern Alaska, who figure in the show. Richard Gadd has won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a limited series, anthology or TV movie, earning recognition for “Baby Reindeer,” a project he created based on his own harrowing experience with a stalker. While accepting his award — which is his second Emmy of the night — Gadd thanked the show’s directors “for bringing out the best in me,” as well as his parents.  “They’re the best,” he said of his mom and dad, adding that they’ve been through “some trying times as a family.” “Baby Reindeer” is a dramatized version of real events that happened to series creator and actor Gadd. In the show, Gadd’s character, Donny, meets Martha (Emmy-winner Jessica Gunning) at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. “Baby Reindeer” has topped most-watched lists worldwide since its debut in April, generating headlines and speculation about the characters and who inspired them. Gadd’s story is real, but he says the version that appears in his thriller miniseries has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. CNN’s Sydney Bishop and Hilary Whiteman contributed reporting. Jimmy Smits, Niecy Nash-Betts and Don Johnson pulled up to the Emmys stage to reflect on their roles as TV cops.  Smits described his “NYPD Blue” character, Det. Bobby Simone, as a “strong and sensitive, street-smart type,” while Nash-Betts joked her “Reno 911!” character, Deputy Raineesha Williams, got by on the job by only having “marginal knowledge of the law.”  Johnson’s character in “Nash Bridges,” meanwhile, played by his own rules but always brought the bad guy to justice.  Smits begrudgingly then pointed out that his “NYPD Blue” character died by the end of it, but Nash-Betts had better luck — her characters always survive.  This year’s In Memoriam was a little bit country with award-winning country singer Jelly Roll performing. Jelly Roll performed his song “I Am Not Okay” and talked about the “healing power” of music and storytelling. Dionne Harmon, one of the awards shows producers, told Variety the singer took a break from his tour to perform for the Emmys Sunday. “He is literally stepping off tour for a day and going right back on the road when he’s done,” said Harmon. “So, we’re so grateful to him. Jesse did a lot of begging to get that!” Music director Rickey Minor told the publication before the show he thought the “decision of what particular song to do will touch everyone.” “I cry every time I hear it,” Minor said. “Everyone at home, make sure you have tons of tissue around.” Following the performance Jimmy Kimmel remembered legendary comedic actor Bob Newhart who died this year. Actor John Leguizamo appeared on stage to recognize the diversity among the nominees at Sunday’s ceremony and speak to representation in Hollywood. He started off specifically honoring the many Latinx nominees present in the audience, including Selena Gomez, Nava Mau and Liza Colón-Zayas. Leguizamo joked that he’s one of “Hollywood’s DEI hires,” going on to define DEI to mean “diligence, excellence and imagination.” (DEI is an acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion, and has been a political flashpoint.) Leguizamo spoke about how when he was younger, he didn’t know that people like him, a person of Latin descent, could be actors.  Leguizamo then recalled the full-page ad he took out in the New York Times directed at the Television Academy, calling on voters to “recognize candidates of color,” joking wryly that the ad alone had solved all the problems in the industry. This year’s list of nominees, he said, is “among the most diverse” in history. With more of the drama categories now in focus, we might be entering the “Shōgun” period of the program. The historical drama just won for best directing in a drama series. “Thank you so much for this,” director Frederick E. O. Toye said.  He thanked Hulu, Disney and FX for giving him the honor to participate in the project.  He thanked the “team of amazing actors and actresses who led the way. I owe them everything,” he said. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, became only the second non-English language program to be nominated in the outstanding drama category. The epic historical drama is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. About a week after its debut, Disney reported that the first episode garnered 9 million views globally across its streaming platforms Hulu+, Disney+ and Star+, making it the company’s top scripted general entertainment series premiere globally. CNN’s Christy Choi and Julia Chatterley contributed to this report. The Emmys went for the gold Sunday night. Jane Lynch and Brendan Hunt — who played coaches on “Glee” and “Ted Lasso,” respectively — presented the best directing for a drama award and had some fun while they were at it, appearing in a locker room set and cracking some jokes. Lynch, who also played Sue Sylvester on “Glee,” teased Hunt that his role as Coach Beard on “Ted Lasso” was just an assistant coach, while she was a head coach. They were joined on stage by several Olympic athletes, including Olympic gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik, who captured hearts this summer as the “Clark Kent” of pommel horse. The FX restaurant dramedy “The Bear” is having a very strong night, as expected. It just picked up another Emmy, this time recognizing Christopher Storer for best directing in a comedy series. Season two of “The Bear” produced some of the most memorable episodes in the series’ history, with the cameo-heavy midseason Christmas episode “Fishes,” earning Storer the win tonight. The episode — a moving portrait of family trauma — generated buzz with its ensemble of guest stars, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, John Mulaney and Jon Bernthal.  Welcome back to the Fonz. The man who played that beloved character, Henry Winkler, reunited with his “Happy Days” costar, Ron Howard, for a little bit of throwback love for the popular series. The pair came together to present an award, but also to remind us all of how much we enjoyed the wholesome show in which Howard started out playing teen Richie Cunningham and introduced the world to his friends and family. “Happy Days” ran over the course of 11 seasons from 1974 to 1984, and won one Primetime Emmy for film editing in 1978. The show enjoyed several other Emmy nominations, including three for Henry Winkler for playing Arthur “The Fonz” Fonzarelli. “Happy Days” firmly put Winkler on the showbiz map, as it did Howard. The Oscar-winning director got his start playing Richie Cunningham on the series. “Happy Days” also led to popular spinoff series including “Joanie Loves Chachi” (1982–83), “Laverne and Shirley” (1976–83), and “Mork and Mindy” (1978–82). The show also helped make the phrase “jump the shark” a thing after Winkler’s character did just that as the series waned in popularity towards the end. The Fonz literally jumped a shark on the show. Richard Gadd took home the Emmy award for outstanding writing for a limited series, anthology or movie. Gadd marked the moment by making a heartfelt speech, reflecting on his personal experience to offer up inspiration for those going through a hard time. A twisty and engrossing tale involving stalking, grooming, abuse and artistic license, “Baby Reindeer” was a sensation when it debuted and has since remained a focus of attention, with some of the real-life players behind it disputing the story’s veracity. Lawsuit context: The series is actually the subject of a lawsuit. Netflix said in June that it would fight a multimillion-dollar claim for damages brought by a Scottish woman who alleges she was defamed by the hit show and its portrayal of a female stalker.  Fiona Harvey is seeking a jury trial and damages totaling $170 million for “mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of business,” according to a complaint filed in the District Court for the Central District of California. The document alleges that the defendants and Gadd told the “biggest lie in television history” by claiming the story is true. For his part, Gadd previously told UK newspaper The Guardian the story is “very emotionally true” but that he wanted the series to exist as a piece of art and protect the identities of those involved. His repeated requests, however, for viewers to cease trying to find out the real-life identities of the figures in his story went unheard. In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Netflix said, “We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd’s right to tell his story.” CNN’s Dan Heching and Hilary Whiteman contributed reporting. Actors Mindy Kaling, Zach Braff and Mekhi Phifer, who have all played TV doctors, appeared on stage to present the award for outstanding writing for a drama series. Phifer, who played a doctor on the hit NBC medical drama “ER,” said he was “so honored” to play a doctor on the show and that he was inspired by all of the physicians he’s known.  Kaling starred as an OB/GYN on her namesake series “The Mindy Project,” and said she was inspired to play a doctor because of her mother, who was also an OB/GYN.  Braff, however, didn’t have as moving of a statement when it came to sharing the inspiration behind playing his beloved role as a doctor on the long-running sitcom “Scrubs.”  “I was inspired to not live like that anymore,” Braff joked.   Lamorne Morris takes home the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a limited series or TV movie for his role on “Fargo.” Morris thanked God, his mother, daughter, cast, the category’s other nominees as well as FX and Hulu while accepting his award. “Oh my god I’m forgetting so many people,” he said, adding that he will thank those he didn’t mention in his speech later, on his podcast. A fan-adored anthology crime series conceived from the Oscar-winning 1996 film of the same name, “Fargo’s” fifth season is in the mix this year with 15 Primetime Emmy nods, having previously won six statuettes in years past. CNN’s Dan Heching contributed reporting. The Emmy for outstanding talk series is awarded to “The Daily Show,” and longtime host John Stewart is up on the stage with the rest of the cast. It was the TV moms’ turn when Susan Kelechi Watson, Connie Britton and Meredith Baxter appeared on stage to present the award for comedy writing.  Britton, who famously played a mom on “Friday Night Lights” and “White Lotus,” said that TV moms “do it all,” whether that be a country music star (on “Nashville”), the head of a “haunted household” or a school principal.  Kelechi Watson, who played mom Beth Pearson on NBC hit show “This is Us,” added that “TV moms are no longer one dimensional… We have choices.”  Kelechi Watson also joked that “it’s ok to ask for as much money as a TV dad.” Baxter — classic TV mom of “Family Ties” fame — also touched on how far TV mom roles have come, saying she’s thankful “we are way past the days where we couldn’t even say the word ‘pregnant’ on ‘I Love Lucy.’” “Hacks” earns the award for outstanding writing for a comedy series at the Emmys, and the cast used their acceptance speech to crack a few jokes. Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky took the award for the episode “Bulletproof.” It’s the second Emmy win for the “Hacks” writers in this category. Downs said the trio of writers chose to write about comedy because they were “three weird lonely kids — it was the thing that made us feel connected to other people.” Statsky and Angelo then playfully corrected Downs, whispering in his ear for him to say they weren’t unpopular. The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. The third season of “Hacks” finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. While presenting the award for writing for a variety special, “Saturday Night Live” vets Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, Bowen Yang and Seth Meyers took the opportunity to poke fun at their current and former boss, “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels.  Wiig joked that Michaels has “lost the Emmy” over 80 times. “You do have value. You are worthy and you are not, and have never been a loser, even though you have lost a lot,” Wiig joked, speaking directly to Michaels in the audience.  Rudolph went on to joke that he was “robbed” every single time he lost, while Yang playfully kept pronouncing his last name wrong.  Meyers pointed out that “SNL” has won many Emmys, with the long-running sketch comedy series earning over 300 nods with 90 wins. “I can’t believe that you’re complaining about this Lorne,” Rudolph said. “Not to be rude but, grow up!” Michaels has won 21 Emmys. It’s never been uncommon for presenters and winners to make political statements at award shows, but it’s especially prevalent in years when there are major elections. This year, with the presidential election happening in just a few weeks, it was to be expected. Then, just hours before Sunday night’s Emmy Awards, there was an apparent second assassination attempt against Republican former President Donald Trump. That could make taking jabs at Trump fraught, but a few people have still worked in some form of political statement. Billy Crudup, who won outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his work on “The Morning Show,” shouted out his wife, Naomi Watts. Watts scored a nomination for her performance as Babe Paley in FX’s anthology series “FEUD: Capote vs. The Swans.” Immigration is a major topic in this year’s election, particularly over the past week, when the GOP ticket has made increasingly inflammatory remarks about Haitian immigrants in the town of Springfield, Ohio. “Murphy Brown” star Candice Bergen drew some laughs by referencing Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s now infamous comment about “childless cat ladies,” after reminiscing about making TV history when her character was attacked in the media by Republican Dan Quayle for a plot line about her being a single mother. Near the top of the show, Selena Gomez also made a reference to the “childless cat ladies” phenomenon when onstage with her “Only Murders in the Building” costars Steve Martin and Martin Short. Jessica Gunning wins outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or TV movie at the 76th Emmy Awards for her twisted role in “Baby Reindeer.” “Oh my goodness me. Blinking heckers, thank you so much,” Gunning began her remarks. “I’m so proud to be a part of ‘Baby Reindeer,’” she said. Gunning then gave an emotional nod to creator of and lead actor in the show, Richard Gadd. “Thank you for trusting me to be your Martha. I will never ever forget her or you,” she said. More on the show: “Baby Reindeer” is a dramatized version of real events that happened to Gadd. In the show, Gadd’s character, Donny, meets Martha at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. “Baby Reindeer” has topped most-watched lists worldwide since its debut in April, generating headlines and speculation about the characters and who inspired them. Gadd’s story is real, but he says the version that appears in his thriller miniseries has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons.

The antics continued with hosts Dan and Eugene Levy, who awkwardly introduced actors and TV villains Kathy Bates, Antony Starr and Giancarlo Esposito from opposite sides of the aisle.  “I don’t know where my dad is,” Dan Levy said, looking around for Eugene Levy, who eventually waved from the ‘wrong’ aisle.  Dan Levy hilariously admonished his father for getting lost in the theater, to which Eugene Levy replied, “I don’t like doing bits in the audience. Never have!” Selena Gomez and her boyfriend Benny Blanco, along with Steve Martin and Paul Rudd, were all in the frame laughing along to the lost Levys bit. The Emmy for outstanding reality or competition series goes to “The Traitors.” The show’s host Alan Cumming thanked Peacock, the cast and crew as well as his home country, Scotland, while accepting the show’s award. The 10-episode reality competition murder mystery show features 20 contestants — 10 of whom have previously appeared on reality programs like “Survivor,” “Below Deck,” “Big Brother” and “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” — competing for $250,000. CNN previously spoke to Cumming about packing for “The Traitors.” Read what some of his travel must-haves are here. CNN’s Jolie Kerr contributed reporting. Jean Smart takes home the award for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series for her role in “Hack” at the Emmys. “Thank you so, so much,” Smart began her speech. “It’s very humbling, it really is and I appreciate this because I — I just don’t get enough attention,” she joked.  Tonight’s win is Smart’s third for “Hacks.” She has won six Primetime Emmys in total. More on the show: The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. In an interview with CNN’s Chris Wallace earlier this year, Smart said she was a bit apprehensive to play opposite Einbinder, a comedian in real life and the daughter of the “Saturday Night Live” original cast member Laraine Newman. Smart said she had never done standup comedy before taking on the role of the brilliant and biting comedian Vance. CNN’s Tori B. Powell and Marianne Garvey contributed to this report. Elizabeth Debicki takes home the Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series. While accepting her award, Debicki — who starred as the “People’s Princess” in “The Crown” — thanked the show’s creator Peter Morgan, as well as the cast and crew behind the series. This is Debicki’s first Emmy win. More on the show: Netflix’s jewel, “The Crown,” has traversed 60 years of world history through the lens of the British monarchy. Debicki played Princess Diana in the most recent season as well as the fifth — a performance for which she earned Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. She’s previously appeared in the BBC’s crime series “The Night Manager,” plus two “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies, “The Man from U.N.C.L.E” and Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” among others. CNN’s Alli Rosenbloom and Sandy Thin contributed reporting. The Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series goes to Liza Colón-Zayas for her role in “The Bear.” “Thank for lowering the microphone for me, thank you so much,” Colón-Zayas began her speech. She then noted how her husband told her not to write a speech. “How-how could I have thought it would be possible to be in the presence” of her fellow nominees including Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett, she asked. “I love you all. I revere you all to the bottom of my heart,” she said. Colón-Zayas also thanked the cast and directors of the show. “Thank you for giving me new life with this show,” she said.  And finally she had a message “to all Latinas who are looking at me, keep believing and vote, vote for your rights, thank you,” While presenting the Emmy for lead actor in a comedy series, famed TV dads Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Damon Wayans and George Lopez took the opportunity to thank their TV wives (and husband). “To be a great TV dad,” Lopez said, you have to have a great TV spouse. Wayans thanked his “My Wife and Kids” co-star Tisha Campbell, Lopez thanked his “George Lopez” show TV wife Constance Marie and Ferguson thanked his “Modern Family” TV husband Eric Stonestreet. “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White wins outstanding lead actor in a comedy series at the 76th Emmy Awards. “This show has changed my life,” White said while accepting the award for his lead role in Hulu and FX’s beloved culinary series. “It has instilled a faith that change is possible,” he continued, adding, “if you are able to reach out, you are really truly never actually alone.” He also thanked the Television Academy as well as his cast mates and his family. White plays Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, the nervy, ultra-talented chef who returns to his hometown of Chicago following the tragic death of his brother. The chance to take over his family’s restaurant comes with a return to the Berzattos’ fraught relationships and past traumas. The show is buoyed by a stellar supporting cast as it explores Carmy’s personal and professional life through the brooding performance of White. CNN’s Matt Meyer contributed reporting. Billy Crudup earned the award for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his role in “The Morning Show” at the Emmys.  “This is an incredible honor, thank you all,” Crudup said. He then gave a shoutout to his wife, actress Naomi Watts, who he noted is an immigrant, and listed her many accolades and successful endeavors.  “This process has been incredible for me and I hope everybody else that’s involved knows how much it means to me,” he said. More on the show: The stakes were raised even higher in the third season of the “The Morning Show” of this taut workplace drama featuring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. The show has already taken home three Primetime Emmys in years past, including one in 2020 for supporting actor Billy Crudup. CNN’s Lisa Respers France and Dan Heching contributed to this report. Ebon Moss-Bachrach wins outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series at the 76th Emmy Awards. While accepting his award, Moss-Bachrach said he’s “so grateful” for “The Bear” and spoke about how much of a “privilege” it was to work with his cast members, whom he referred to as his “incredible family.” Moss-Bachrach also thanked his parents, who he joked are “taking such nice care of my cat” as well as his children. Hulu and FX’s beloved culinary series is about the inner workings of a high-pressured chef and his staff in a Chicago restaurant. Nominally considered a comedy at tonight’s awards, “The Bear” can be very funny. But it’s best known for its tension-drenched scenes inside the kitchen and its moving exploration of family dynamics. The show has risen from a favorite of TV nerds to the next “prestige TV” hit, while the restaurant at the center of the series has transformed from a sandwich shop to a high-end eatery. Father-son duo and Emmys hosts Dan and Eugene Levy kicked off Sunday’s ceremony joking about how hosting is a new experience for the pair, who joked they “more like actors acting like hosts.”  Dan Levy acknowledged this is the first time they worked together since starring alongside each other in “Schitt’s Creek,” which ended in 2020. Eugene Levy spoke of his famed roles playing movie and TV dads — including his role in “American Pie” — and joked that his best “dad role” was in “Schitt’s Creek” because it won him his first Emmy. The Canadian-bred actors joked about how they don’t wish to cut any winners off early while they make their acceptance speeches, with Eugene Levy saying, “If you’re going to say anything meaningful or emotional or, god forbid, political, just keep it short…” Schitt’s Creek ran from 2015 to 2020 and starred Catherine O’Hara, Annie Murphy, Emily Hampshire and Noah Reid, among others. The series won nine Emmys during its run, with five of those wins coming in 2020 for the beloved series’ final season. Dan Levy, Eugene Levy, O’Hara and Murphy all swept the acting categories, and the show won best comedy. Lots of the evening’s men are eschewing traditional black-tie in favor of something more flamboyant. “Abbott Elementary” star Chris Perfetti impressed in a theatrical ruffled shirt from Christian Siriano’s Spring 2025 ready-to-wear collection and “Fallout” star Aaron Moten arrived in an all-red Kenzo suit with a Nehru collar. “The Traitors” actor Alan Cumming and fellow Scot Richard Gadd, creator of “Baby Reindeer,” both wore kilts (in black and traditional tartan, respectively), with the former’s plaid cummerbund train emerging from his cream Teddy von Ranson jacket to double up as a scarf.Even those men opting for more conventional tailoring incorporated playful touches, from host Dan Levy’s sculpted Loewe neckline to the silky unbuttoned shirt of Jonathan Bailey’s Giorgio Armani suit.

The limited series “Baby Reindeer” has topped most-watched lists worldwide since its debut in April, gripping audiences on Netflix while generating headlines and speculation. Series creator and actor Richard Gadd says it is a dramatized version of real events that happened to him, but that it has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. He’s also repeatedly urged fans not to seek out the real-life inspirations for the project, which is about a man who is aggressively stalked by a woman he meets in a London bar. But that hasn’t dissuaded super-fans and online sleuths, and now a Scottish woman who says she was defamed by the hit show is seeking a jury trial and damages totaling $170 million for “mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of business,” according to California court filings. The document alleges that the defendants and Gadd told the “biggest lie in television history” by claiming the story is true. For his part, Gadd previously told UK newspaper The Guardian the story is “very emotionally true” but that he wanted the series to exist as a piece of art and to protect the identities of those involved. In a June statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Netflix said, “We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd’s right to tell his story.” Selena Gomez has arrived on the red carpet. “Only Murders in the Building,” which Gomez acts in and produces, scored 21 primetime Emmy nominations this year, including her first individual acting nomination. The series stars Gomez, Steve Martin and Martin Short as three neighbors in an upscale New York building who are true crime fans.

The two said in a joint statement last month that they are “thrilled to able to raise a glass to this extraordinary season of television.” The pair will follow most recent Emmys hosts Anthony Anderson, Kenan Thompson and Cedric the Entertainer. No, you’re not imagining things. It was “television’s biggest night” a matter of months ago. Due to a pair of Hollywood strikes, the 75th Emmy Awards were postponed until last January. When the delayed awards show finally took place, we saw “The Bear” and “Succession” as the biggest winners, picking up six Emmys each. The industry’s writers and actors remain back at work and we return to our regularly scheduled programming: Tonight’s awards will celebrate shows released between June 1, 2023 and May 31, 2024. “Succession” has concluded, having used its strong showing at the January awards to cement its status as one of the best drama series in recent years. But “The Bear” looks poised to have another big night on the back of its critically lauded second season. The FX hit’s third season was released in June and will be eligible to contend during next year’s Emmys.  The nominees for the 76th Emmy Awards — television’s top honor — were announced earlier this summer, and “The Bear” ate it up. The beloved FX series, set in a Chicago sandwich shop-turned-high-end eatery, scored 23 nominations this year, breaking the record of 22 set by the NBC hit “30 Rock” back in 2009. In the drama category, “Shōgun” had the most nominations this year with 25. The all-time record of 32 nominations, held by HBO’s “Game of Thrones” since 2016, remains unbroken. HBO is owned by CNN’s parent company. Some past favorites, including “Succession” and “Ted Lasso,” were not in contention this year, but “The Crown,” “The Morning Show” and “Only Murders in the Building” became the new “legacy shows” with multiple nominations. Here are some of the nominees to watch tonight: Outstanding drama series: Outstanding comedy series: Outstanding limited series: Outstanding reality/competition series: Outstanding talk series: Outstanding lead actor in a comedy series: Outstanding lead actress in a drama series: See the full list of nominees here."
Trump safe after being targeted in second apparent assassination attempt | CNN Politics,"Updated 1:51 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-15T18:30:41.952Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/donald-trump-safe-shots/index.html,"The FBI is investigating what it said is an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump at his Florida golf club Sunday, the second time in two months there’s been an apparent attempt on the former president’s life. Trump is safe and was not harmed in the incident, his campaign said. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said during a Sunday news conference that his office was informed at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the Secret Service, when agents fired at a man who had a rifle in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club. Trump had been playing golf at the time, moving between holes five and six, a source briefed on the matter told CNN. A Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of the fence of the golf course and “immediately engaged” with the person, Bradshaw said. The agent who spotted the rifle, Bradshaw said, is part of a team that stays a hole or two ahead of Trump on the course. The person was 300 to 500 yards away from Trump, an official said. The person fled the scene in a car and was spotted by a witness, which ultimately helped law enforcement officials locate the vehicle driving north on I-95 in Martin County, one county to the north of Palm Beach. “We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Bradshaw said. Authorities alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the person. The witness was able to then identify the man. David Aronberg, State Attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida, said the suspect said nothing as he was detained. “He knew enough to stay silent,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Sunday evening. “He did not apparently speak to officers, he was calm. So, it looked like a person who has done this before, not necessarily this crime, but someone who has had repeated interactions with law enforcement.” The person in custody in connection with the apparent attempted assassination is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources. The self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii went on social media to weigh in on politics and current events, at times criticizing the former president, and expressed strong support for Ukraine. Routh traveled to Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor more than two years ago, according to video and images geolocated by CNN to Kyiv’s Independence Square. Video shows Routh attended a rally at the square in support of Ukrainian troops on May 1, 2022 and visited the same location about six weeks later, where a photo shows him standing beside a Ukraine flag emblazoned with an appeal for international volunteers to support the war effort. The FBI’s investigation has gone global as officials work to flesh out his background, a law enforcement source told CNN. Some of Routh’s suspected online activity also involved the use of platforms headquartered outside the United States, the source said, which will involve working with international partners to identify everything the FBI possibly can about the detained individual. Officials said an AK-47-style rifle with a scope; two backpacks that were hung on the fence and had ceramic tile in them; and a GoPro camera were recovered at the scene. The holes Trump was playing when the incident occurred are on the eastern edge of the golf course. Trump had no public events on his schedule for Sunday, and his golf game was a last-minute addition to his itinerary, two sources familiar with the matter said. The apparent assassination attempt at Trump’s golf course in Florida comes two months after an assassination attempt against the former president at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally that sparked scrutiny of the US Secret Service. “Former President Donald Trump is safe and unharmed following a possible attempted assassination shortly before 2 p.m. Sunday at Trump International Golf Club at West Palm Beach. US Secret Service personnel opened fire on a gunman located near the property line,” Rafael Barros, the Secret Service special agent in charge of the Miami field office, said in a statement. Ronald Rowe, acting director of the US Secret Service, is traveling to Florida in the wake of the incident, a law enforcement source familiar with the matter told CNN. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that his state would conduct its own investigation of the apparent thwarted assassination attempt. And the congressional task force that’s investigating the first attempted assassination of the former president is requesting a briefing with the Secret Service following Sunday’s incident. Trump’s campaign said in a statement earlier in the day that the former president “is safe following gunshots in his vicinity.” Trump — who had been golfing with donor Steve Witkoff, according to a source familiar with the matter — soon assured supporters that he was safe, too. “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!” Trump wrote in a fundraising email that afternoon. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been briefed on the security incident involving Trump and they are both “relieved to know that he is safe,” according to the White House. “As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety,” Biden said in a statement Sunday evening. Harris echoed Biden’s support for the Secret Service having “every resource, capability, and protective measure necessary to carry out its critical mission” in her own statement released by the White House Sunday night. “I am deeply disturbed by the possible assassination attempt of former President Trump today,” she said. “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence.” Biden and Harris, both of whom are in Washington, DC, with no public events Sunday, will be kept updated by their team. Attorney General Merrick Garland has also been briefed, according to Department of Justice spokesperson Dena Iverson. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, wrote on X later Sunday that the former president is in “good spirits.” “I’m glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,” Vance said. “He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham posted. “He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country,” the Trump ally wrote.

The one Harris comment Trump and his allies have spent $38 million for voters to see | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 PM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T16:00:19.735Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/kamala-harris-bidenomics-trump-advertisements/index.html,"On an August afternoon last year in Washington, Kamala Harris appeared at a retail village to promote the Biden administration’s economic record. “Bidenomics is working,” the vice president announced, touting the latest round of job numbers. “That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics.” It was a fateful declaration, one that has dogged Harris since she took over as the Democratic standard-bearer and has attempted to seize the mantle of change candidate in the 2024 presidential race. The Trump campaign and its allies have spent more than $38 million replaying that soundbite almost 70,000 times in campaign advertisements since Harris became the Democratic nominee, looking to capitalize on persistent voter concerns about the economy and blunt Harris’ turn-the-page messaging by yoking her to President Joe Biden’s record. One of the ads, backed by more than $13 million, simply juxtaposes Harris on the campaign trail in 2024, speaking to voter concerns about rising prices, with the clip from 2023, and includes no other narration. “Everyday prices are too high – food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes,” Harris says in the clip featured in the ad. What Immediately follows is the 2023 clip of her saying, “That is called Bidenomics.” Another one of the ads, also backed by more than $13 million, contrasts news coverage of inflation with the same 2023 clip, taking the same spare approach, also with no other narration. A third ad from the Trump campaign, launched last week and already backed by more than $3 million, opens with the clip of Harris saying that “Bidenomics is working,” before a narrator cuts in with “It’s not” and references more critical news coverage of inflation. “Yet Harris still says, ‘Bidenomics working.’ No, it isn’t,” the ad ends. A fourth ad featuring the soundbite went up Friday. Throughout the campaign, Trump and his allies have taken a two-track approach to their attacks against Harris – on the one hand linking immigration and crime, and amplifying public safety concerns; while on the other, slamming the Biden-Harris economic record, with a particular focus on inflation. The spree of ads replaying Harris’ endorsement of “Bidenomics” reflects the latter approach, and that share of the pro-Trump messaging has been increasing in recent weeks as the campaign fine-tunes its advertising strategy for the final weeks of the race. The ads are aimed at leveraging the advantage that polls show voters give Trump on economic issues and magnifying persistent concerns about inflation and a potential recession – even as inflation in the actual economy has slowed and job growth has continued. Harris and her allies, meanwhile, have made a concerted effort to blunt those criticisms, also leaning into economic messaging in their campaign advertising. Last week, Harris’ campaign launched a series of ads on her economic pitch, specifically tailored to key swing states. “Lowering the cost of living will be a defining goal of my presidency. I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone. And I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gouging on food. More than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut. We will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class,” Harris says in the ads. In addition, her campaign has spent more than $10 million airing an ad in which Harris says, “You want lower prices and lower taxes. I believe you want to just not get by, but you want to get ahead,” before delivering her pitch for an “opportunity economy.” And another top Harris ad contrasts her approach with Trump’s. “It’s a very different vision than Donald Trump’s. His plans will raise costs and taxes on the vast majority of Americans. We need to be thinking about the future and how we make it better for families like yours,” Harris says in the ad. Democrats – including Biden and Harris – ditched the “Bidenomics” branding long ago as part of their messaging on the economy. For the vice president, her approach to the issue since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket speaks to the balancing act she has faced when it comes to embracing the administration’s record, including during her first sit-down interview as the nominee last month with CNN. “So you maintain Bidenomics is a success?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Harris during an exchange about her economic plans. “I maintain that when we do the work,” Harris responded before launching into a litany of the administration’s achievements. “I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work.” The backdrop to the back-and-forth over who is best for voters’ pocketbooks is a US economy that has continued to post solid data, even as prices are higher than four years ago and interest rates are elevated. Inflation has slowed significantly from its peak in 2022, and the US economy added 142,000 jobs in August, marking stronger growth than a worrisome lower number in July. Still, the ads from the Trump campaign also reflect the basic conundrum facing all politicians – they spend hours before the public, staking out positions and making statements, all while political operatives and ad-makers watch for a moment to capitalize. Harris, standing in southeast DC in August 2023, could not have known that exactly one year later, she would face the challenge of pitching an entirely different vision to voters."
The Fed keeps brushing off concerns about another Trump presidency. Its closed-door meetings show otherwise | CNN Business,"Published 11:00 AM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T15:00:19.953Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/economy/federal-reserve-concerns-about-trump/index.html,"Federal Reserve officials won’t say how former President Donald Trump winning a second term could impact the economy. Actually, the Fed prides itself on avoiding even the suggestion that it is wading into politics. But transcripts of closed-door Fed meetings from Trump’s first term give some clues about top economists’ true feelings about Trump’s economic agenda. If voted into office in the November US presidential election, Trump has promised to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on all foreign imports, up to 60% for some Chinese products, and levies as high as 100% for countries that abandon the dollar as their reserve currency. If enacted, those policies could have wide-reaching effects on the US economy as well as economies across the globe. To better understand what that could look like, US lawmakers have sought the input of the leader of the largest economy in the world: Fed Chair Jerome Powell. But when asked in congressional hearings, press conferences and in letters from lawmakers to weigh in on the issue of tariffs, Powell has stood his ground. As head of the US central bank, an independent and apolitical agency, he said he has an obligation not to comment on political agendas. “We also don’t comment on trade policy,” Powell said in response to a question from Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in July, when asked about the effect of the tariffs that Trump has proposed. “We don’t want to be involved … in politics in any way,” Powell said after July’s monetary policy meeting. At the same time, the policies elected officials enact undeniably have an impact on the economy, and as Fed officials cast votes on where they believe interest rates should be to fulfill their mandate for stable prices and maximum employment, they have to consider the effect of fiscal policy. “When Congress does deficit spending, that can be stimulative, that goes into our models,” Powell said in a “60 Minutes” interview earlier this year. “But … it’s not our role at all to be a judge of fiscal policy in any way.” So it’s not surprising that Fed officials discussed the potential economic impact of the tariffs Trump either campaigned on or enacted when he was president. Although the size of the tariffs Trump floated or put forth during his first term were considerably smaller than the ones he’s currently campaigning on, transcripts documenting discussions Fed officials had around them give early hints of how central bankers could see Trump’s latest tariff proposals affecting the economy. The transcripts of past meetings that are publicly available, the most recent being from the December 2018 monetary policy meeting, suggest that some Fed officials had legitimate concerns about Trump’s trade policy and its impact on the economy. The Fed keeps transcripts locked up for years to steer clear of political interference. The Fed declined to comment to CNN. When the Fed’s monetary policy committee met in December 2016 for the first time after Trump was elected, officials struggled with how to factor in the agenda he campaigned on involving steeper tariffs, tax cuts and stricter controls on immigration with forecasts they make on the economic outlook. Those forecasts influence the monetary policy decisions officials make. The general consensus among officials was to wait and see what happens, but some were already bracing for negative consequences. For instance, according to a meeting transcript, Loretta Mester, then-president of the Cleveland Fed, said: “Policies that constrain immigration and trade would have negative effects for the US economy over the medium and longer run, but I have not incorporated these into my projections at this point.” Mester, who retired from working at the Fed three months ago, told CNN that such discussions are normal for Fed officials who have to take a forward-looking approach when setting interest rates. “This means policymakers need to assess the outlook and the risks around the outlook,” she said, adding that fiscal policy factors into that equation. “Political considerations do not come into it and are never discussed at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings,” Mester said. At that meeting, James Bullard, who was at that time president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, quipped: “According to some interpretations of the Book of Revelations, when three unusual events occur together, they may be a sign that the apocalypse is near.” “Let’s take stock,” he continued. “The Chicago Cubs have won the World Series, Donald Trump has won the presidency and Bob Dylan has won a Nobel Prize,” Bullard said, referring to three events that occurred in 2016. His comments were met with laughter from other meeting participants, according to the Fed’s transcript of the meeting. Bullard, now the dean of Purdue’s Mitch Daniels School of Business, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. At later meetings, as the Trump administration began to set the stage for a potential trade war with China, Fed officials started to sound more concerned. At times, they even veered into territory that appeared critical of political agendas. “The professed goal of the Trump administration, to get tough on trade, could lead not necessarily to better trade deals for the United States, but just a significant increase in trade barriers and the resultant bad set of consequences that would flow from that, including higher inflation,” William Dudley, then the Vice Chair of the Fed, said at the monetary policy meeting that took place from January 31 to February 1, 2017. “So it seems to me that we may be trading a greater likelihood of a sustained expansion over the next year or two for a greater likelihood of a hard landing later,” Dudley added. A hard landing refers to when the Fed is unable to bring inflation down without causing the economy to enter a recession. Dudley did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for a comment. “The longer-run effects of some of the policy changes being contemplated, in particular with respect to trade and immigration, could be quite negative,” Mester said at the same meeting. “There are other risks, too, including geopolitical risks, some arising from a potentially escalating array of ill-conceived US government policies.”"
Fact check: Trump falsely claims Harris is talking about bringing back the military draft | CNN Politics,"Published 10:18 AM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T14:18:31.567Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/fact-check-trump-harris-military-draft/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump has conjured up an inflammatory false claim about Vice President Kamala Harris’ policy positions — baselessly saying Friday that Harris is talking about forcing Americans to serve in the military. Trump claimed at a rally in Las Vegas that voting for Harris means voting for war with Russia and voting to bring back the draft, a system in which some men are conscripted into involuntary service in the armed forces. Trump continued: “Would anybody like to be drafted, in the audience? Because that’s what they’re doing. She’s already talking about bringing back the draft. She wants to bring back the draft, and draft your child, and put them in a war that should never have happened.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris is not talking about bringing back the draft and has not put forward any proposals to bring back the draft. Trump’s campaign did not respond Saturday to CNN’s requests for any evidence for his claim. A Harris campaign aide said, “We have no idea what he’s talking about.” The US has not had a draft since 1973, the year it completed its military withdrawal from Vietnam. (Trump received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War draft, four because he was a college student and a fifth on account of a doctor’s diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels.) Since 1973, the country has used an all-volunteer force. Regardless of the wishes of any president, launching a new draft would require Congress to pass legislation. The current situation Almost all male US citizens and non-citizen immigrants ages 18 through to 25 are already required by law to register in a federal database system, the Selective Service System, so that they could potentially be conscripted into the military if another draft eventually happened. It’s entirely unclear what prompted Trump to make his Friday claim, but there has been some media coverage related to the Selective Service System in recent months. Members of Congress have been debating separate proposals to automatically register men for the database when they turn 18 — some men currently have to register manually, though registration is mandatory — and to start requiring women to register. Both proposals face significant congressional opposition and may well fail to become law. Regardless, they are not proposals to revive the draft, and, more to the point here, Harris herself certainly hasn’t called to revive the draft."
Live updates: FBI investigating apparent assassination attempt of Trump in Florida | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-15T12:30:37.321Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-09-15-24/index.html,"Our live coverage of the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump has moved here. Ryan Routh had repeatedly called for bolstering Taiwan’s defenses against China and hoped to set up a foreign legion akin to that in Ukraine.  The man, who was detained in connection with an apparent attempt to assassinate former president Donald Trump on Sunday, is listed as an “International Volunteer Center Coordinator” on a website named Taiwan Foreign Legion.  The group claims it is “recruiting former military and civilians from around the world” willing to defend Taiwan in the event of a war with China.  CNN reached out to over a dozen people listed as “supporters” on the group’s website. But several said they had not heard of the group or its activities, and some had never heard of Routh.   All claimed they did not know how their names and contact information had been shared on the pro-Taiwan website.  Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan does not have an official foreign legion. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry declined to comment on Routh.  China’s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. The US is bound by law to supply the self-governing island with weapons to defend itself, and support for Taiwan is a rare issue of broadly bipartisan consensus in Washington.  Ryan Wesley Routh decried Donald Trump as an “idiot,” a “buffoon” and a “fool” in his self-published book on the war in Ukraine and geopolitics. The 58-year-old, who was detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Trump, wrote last year about his unsuccessful efforts to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia and also weighed in on multiple global crises. Routh wrote that the former US president’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 was a “tremendous blunder” that drove Tehran closer to Moscow, which it has supplied with drones that have caused devastation across Ukraine. Routh also gave his opinions on the political situation in Afghanistan, and urged Afghan refugees to fight for Ukraine. He also wrote about Taiwan, North Korea and Venezuela, drawing comparisons between the authoritarian rule of President Nicolas Maduro and the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Appearing to reference his former support for Trump, Routh wrote that he must take part of the blame for electing him as president, writing: “but I am man enough to say that I misjudged and made a terrible mistake.” Leaders around the world are condemning the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump and offering their support. Here’s what they’re saying: The FBI said it “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, just two months after an attempt to kill the Republican presidential nominee at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president was not harmed. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii, has been detained in connection with Sunday’s incident, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what happened: Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf, was a staunch supporter of Ukraine and visited the country in 2022. Routh traveled to Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor more than two years ago, according to video and images geolocated by CNN to Kyiv’s Independence Square, as well as interviews with foreign press. Video shows Routh attended a rally at the square in support of Ukrainian troops on May 1, 2022, and visited the same location about six weeks later, where a photo shows him standing beside a Ukraine flag emblazoned with an appeal for international volunteers to support the war effort In an April 2022 video by AFP in Kyiv, Routh called Putin a “terrorist” and said “he needs to be ended.” A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Routh also expressed support for Ukraine on social media. In dozens of posts on X in 2022, he said he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”  Routh then used Facebook to encourage foreigners to fight in the war. He tried to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts, beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government.   This post has been updated with more information on Routh’s time in Ukraine. A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion confirmed with CNN that Ryan Wesley Routh had contacted them several times but said he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Shaguri said “the best way to describe his messages is — delusional ideas.” Routh expressed support for Ukraine in dozens of X posts in 2022, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.” He also visited Ukraine in 2022, according to video and photos geolocated by CNN as well as media interviews he gave while there.  Routh then used his Facebook account last year to encourage foreigners to fight in the war. He tried to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts, beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea, who met the man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Ukraine on several occasions, told CNN he was surprised by Ryan Routh’s involvement in the incident. Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June of 2022, where Routh was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. At the time, Routh gave Newsweek Romania an interview where he said: When Cernea met Routh again about a year later, he said, Routh was visibly frustrated that more people had not come to Ukraine’s help. “Why aren’t there thousands of people here in Kyiv coming to support and join the foreign legion, why aren’t they here?” Cernea remembers him lamenting. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company, has been detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what we know about him: This post has been updated with the latest developments. Ryan Wesley Routh, the 58-year-old man detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, self-published a book last year detailing his efforts to support Ukraine in the war against Russia. In the 291-page book, Routh described his disillusionment with the war in Ukraine, which he called “unwinnable.” The book also discussed the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and the political situation in Taiwan, which has faced growing military threats from China. The book, released on Amazon with no publisher listed, is titled: “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen-Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity.” CNN has not independently verified his accounts in the book. In it, Routh describes how he had traveled to the Poland-Ukraine border in an effort to enlist in the war — but “at 56 with absolutely no military experience I was reluctantly turned away by the staff” at the border office. Instead, he tried to enlist more fighters for the war effort — traveling to Kyiv and setting up a makeshift volunteer center at Independence Square before it was disassembled by police. He then “lost all arguments and calls to city hall,” he writes, and spent several months camped out in protest at various locations around the city. “I had given every ounce of motivation and energy that I could muster for Ukraine and came up empty handed,” he said, describing his unsuccessful attempts to build drones for the Ukrainian army with a team of international engineers.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was shocked after hearing about the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. “Sara and I were shocked by the second assassination attempt against President Trump and were relieved to hear that it too failed. But we should not rely on luck,” he wrote on X. Federal agents investigating an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday expect a federal court in South Florida will require “a mental health assessment” of Ryan Wesley Routh before any possible criminal proceedings, a law enforcement source told CNN.  Based on numerous “unusual rants” believed to be posted by Routh online regarding international geopolitical events, the source said federal investigators expect his mental health will be examined as part of court proceedings to determine whether he is fit for any trial.  No charges have been filed, but mental health assessments are not uncommon in cases involving threats to federal officials by individuals who may be experiencing mental health issues, the source said. CNN is attempting to determine if Routh has attorney representation.  There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speaks to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. Read the full analysis. Former President Donald Trump on Sunday thanked the US Secret Service and other law enforcement officials after an apparent assassination attempt while he was golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida. The former president was not harmed in the incident. He had been golfing with donor Steve Witkoff when shots were fired, according to a source familiar with the matter. The presence of law enforcement outside Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach remains heavy, and the road nearest the apparent assassination attempt was still closed nine hours after the incident, CNN Correspondent Randi Kaye reported from the scene. Heavily trafficked roads around the golf club are also still closed and there has been a regular stream of police vans going in and out of the gates. At Summit Boulevard, just in front of the golf club gate, there are a lot of bushes between where the 5th and 6th hole comes together, Kaye said, where perhaps somebody could have poked their way through until they reached the fence. The person detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources. Trump International Golf Club abuts three heavily trafficked roads: Kirk Road, Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. The Palm Beach International Airport is also nearby. The man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in Florida remained silent when he was apprehended by law enforcement, according to a local state attorney.  Aronberg did not name the suspect but said he had a “rap sheet.”  The person detained is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources.  Aronberg described the apparent assassination attempt as “another too close for comfort incident.” But he also praised the US Secret Service for quickly spotting the alleged shooter and firing shots at him.  Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who serves on the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July, said people in Congress are “bewildered why we’re in this situation for a second time.” He says the protocols and resources committed to the former president “seem to be wholly inadequate,” especially in outdoor environments. Moskowitz said that, although much remains unknown, the man detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt on Trump on a golf course should not have been able to obtain a firearm in the state of Florida. He said it should not be ruled out that the man may have brought the weapon into the state. Motorist Daniel Rodriguez told CNN that he and his family were driving back to Orlando on the I-95 interstate from a soccer match when they encountered a “wild scene” as sheriff’s deputies stopped a suspect after an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Rodriguez said that they initially thought it was an accident. Rodriguez said they were then stuck in traffic for two hours. Former President Donald Trump’s golf game on Sunday was a last-minute addition to his schedule, two sources familiar with the matter said. Trump had no public events on his schedule for Sunday. Vice President Kamala Harris said she is “disturbed” and condemns “political violence” after an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday. “I am deeply disturbed by the possible assassination attempt of former President Trump today. As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said in a statement released by the White House on Sunday night. The FBI’s investigation into an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida has gone global as officials work to flesh out the background of Ryan Wesley Routh, the individual detained, a law enforcement source tells CNN. Authorities are working to obtain search warrants on social media accounts believed to be associated with Routh, the source said. Some of Routh’s suspected online activity also involved using platforms headquartered outside the United States, the source said, which will involve working with international partners to identify everything the FBI possibly can about the detained individual. The FBI is also aware of Routh’s suspected online claims about foreign travel, the source said, which will be part of the bureau’s investigation. While early in the investigation, authorities have not identified any co-conspirators potentially targeting Trump, the source said. Records from North Carolina, dating back a couple decades, show that the man detained in the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday has had previous scrapes with the law.    In 2002, Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested after he was pulled over by police and allegedly put his hand on a firearm and then drove and barricaded himself in a business, according to a Greensboro News & Record article that year that cited police. Law enforcement confirmed the arrest to CNN on Sunday.   Public records reveal several court cases involving Routh since the 1990s.   State and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. For example, he faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records.  In 1998, the state alleged he committed an offense related to a “worthless check,” though that case was dismissed.   Separately, judges have ordered him to pay tens of thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits.  Routh’s eldest son, Oran, told CNN via text that Routh was “a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man.”   The son wrote, “I don’t know what’s happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I’ve heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent.”  A 58-year-old man detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida is a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii who went on social media to weigh in on politics and current events, at times criticizing the former president.   Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf, posted comments on an X account linked to him referencing the assassination attempt on Trump in July.    Routh tagged President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, in separate posts, encouraging them to visit those injured at the rally.  “You and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally and attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them,” he wrote in a post directed at Harris.  In an April post on X tagging Biden’s presidential account, he wrote Biden’s campaign should be: “called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA …make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.”   Ronald Rowe, acting director of the US Secret Service, is traveling to Florida in the wake of the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, a law enforcement source familiar with the matter told CNN. The official declined to comment on Rowe’s itinerary.  Rowe has been in the top job at the Secret Service since Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July amid scrutiny over security lapses related to the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.  Rowe also visited the site of the Butler shooting, and he has testified on Capitol Hill and briefed members of Congress about the investigation into that shooting. Rowe has been asked to brief lawmakers about the Florida incident as well.   Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced his state will conduct “its own investigation regarding the attempted assassination” of former President Donald Trump, his one-time GOP primary opponent, in West Palm Beach. “The people deserve the truth about the would be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards of the former president and current GOP nominee,” DeSantis wrote on X. President Joe Biden commended the work of the Secret Service and law enforcement following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, saying he was “relieved” to hear that Trump was unharmed. He also condemned political violence or “any violence” and said that he has directed his team to ensure that the Secret Service has all the resources necessary to protect the former president. “As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety,” he added. The son of the person detained following the shooting incident on former President Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida on Sunday told CNN that he hopes everything has “just been blown out of proportion” and that it’s not like his father “to do anything crazy, much less violent.” Oran Routh, son of Ryan Routh, said his father is loving, caring and hardworking. CNN reported earlier that officials detained Ryan Routh following the shooting incident on Sunday, according to three law enforcement sources. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday condemned violence against public officials and candidates. In a post on X, Mayorkas also commended the US Secret Service for “its quick action to preempt this apparent assassination attempt and protect the former President.” “DHS and the Secret Service are closely working with federal, state and local law enforcement partners to learn all of the facts surrounding this incident. The safety and security of Presidential candidates and other protectees is the highest priority for the Secret Service, ” Mayorkas said.  Former President Donald Trump was at his Trump International Golf Club, between the fifth and sixth holes, when the Secret Service fired on a suspect spotted some distance ahead of the former president on the course. Here’s where the incident happened: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday he is “very grateful President Trump is safe after another attempted assassination attempt.”  “There is no place for political violence in our country, and those responsible for it must be held to account. I hope and expect (the Secret Service) and the FBI will conduct a thorough, swift, and transparent investigation,” the Kentucky Republican wrote on X. Former President Donald Trump updated his fundraising website with a defiant message after the security incident. “FEAR NOT! I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God! But, there are people in this world who will do whatever it takes to stop us.I will not stop fighting for you. I will Never Surrender,” the website says. “I will always love you for supporting me. Through our UNITY we will Make America Great Again.” House Speaker Mike Johnson met with Donald Trump this afternoon following what the FBI is calling an apparent assassination attempt against the former president in South Florida. Donald Trump’s campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles updated staff after shots were fired near the former president Sunday, telling them in an email that “safety is always our top priority.” CNN previously reported that Trump’s campaign office in West Palm Beach, Florida, went into lockdown after the Sunday incident. LaCivita and Wiles also praised the Secret Service. “President Trump and everyone accompanying him are safe thanks to the great work of the United States Secret Service,” they said. Former President Donald Trump said in a second fundraising email Sunday that his “resolve is only stronger” after shots were fired near him at the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida. “My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life!” the email said. “I will never slow down. I will never give up. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER!” The FBI “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump, the agency said Sunday, just two months after an attempt on the former president’s life at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president is safe after shots were fired at Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. Here’s what happened: US intelligence officials recently briefed Donald Trump’s campaign about new indications that Iran was planning to escalate attacks on the former president and those around him, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. At this point, there is no indication that the intelligence is related to the apparent second assassination attempt against on Trump on Sunday, the sources said. The intelligence briefing given in recent days related to potential physical and cybersecurity attacks, adding to the overall elevated security threat against Trump. CNN previously reported that authorities had obtained intelligence about a plot by Iran to assassinate Trump in the weeks before the attempted assassination of the former president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July. There has been no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who was shot and killed that day, was connected to the plot. Separately, the US government has concluded the Iranian government is behind a hack-and-leak operation targeting Trump’s campaign and also attempted to target the Biden-Harris campaign. The congressional task force investigating the first attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump is requesting a briefing with the US Secret Service following the Sunday security incident at Trump’s golf club in Florida. The person in custody in connection with the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources. What we know so far about the person detained: Not too long ago, Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a staccato of shots rang out in the middle of his speech, killing one attendee and severely injuring two others. According to the FBI, either a bullet or a bullet fragment struck Trump, wounding him on the ear. The incident sparked a broader investigation around lapses in Trump’s security apparatus, increasing scrutiny on the Secret Service. Amid a possible second assassination attempt, lawmakers and officials are still in the process of investigating the first attempt on Trump’s life. A flashback to Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania: Video showed some attendees noticed the gunman on the roof at least one minute and 57 seconds before the shooting began, and several rally attendees tried to call attention to the gunman as Trump was speaking on the stage. The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was fatally shot at the scene. Secret Service boosts security: Since the incident, the Secret Service has bolstered Trump’s security detail and surrounds the former president with bulletproof glass at campaign rallies. A senior official told CNN additional security measures would also include increasing the number of agents and certain technological changes, though the official declined to provide more details. The fallout: Then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July amid criticism for security lapses related to the assassination attempt, and the agency is under continued pressure from lawmakers to hold individuals accountable for those failures. Ronald Rowe, now acting director of the Secret Service, had said several times he would wait until the results of internal investigations into the shooting before making personnel decisions over that day’s failures. Multiple Secret Service personnel from the Pittsburgh Field Office and one member of Trump’s security detail involved in the planning for the July 13 rally were reassigned to administrative duties and ordered to work from home. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he has been briefed by acting Secret Service Director Ronald L. Rowe, Jr. after shots were fired at Trump International Golf Club near former President Donald Trump. “I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump’s safety,” Schumer added. “There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz said he and his wife are “glad” that former President Donald Trump is safe following what the FBI is saying is an apparent assassination attempt against him. The statement, which follows closely to what Vice President Kamala Harris wrote earlier, also condemns violence. Golf courses, and in particular Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds while the commander in chief plays, according to people familiar with the matter. A golf course is often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements like trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the president as he plays and secure the areas in the several minutes before he arrives. Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach abuts three heavily trafficked roads: Kirk Road, Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. The Palm Beach International Airport is also nearby. As president, Trump could often be spotted from across from Kirk Road when he was playing golf. But members of the media were not permitted to stand on the sidewalks near the golf course when Trump was playing. After he left office, some of those restrictions were lifted. Members of the public were able to have a clear view of Trump from the sidewalks on Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. In a briefing Sunday, the Palm Beach County sheriff acknowledged that with Trump now not a sitting president, the Secret Service was “limited” in its ability to fully surround the golf course. When he was president, Barack Obama’s most frequent golf outing was to the links at Joint Base Andrews, which, by its nature on a military installation, had restricted access — both to the course itself but also its surroundings. President Joe Biden rarely golfs. Former President Donald Trump is back at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida following what the FBI is calling an apparent assassination attempt. The former president and his motorcade left the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach after Secret Service spotted and engaged with a gunman who was positioned on the perimeter of the club. The suspect fled the scene in a car but was later detained by law enforcement. Former President Donald Trump’s South Florida golf course would have been “surrounded” with protection if he were the sitting president, but the US Secret Service was “limited” in the areas it was able to cover ahead of Sunday’s incident, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference. “The golf course is surrounded by shrubbery, so when somebody gets into the shrubbery, they’re pretty much out of sight, all right, and at this level that he is at right now, he’s not the sitting president,” Bradshaw said. “If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible. So, I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there’ll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter. But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done.” Watch here: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he spoke with former President Donald Trump after the security incident in Florida on Sunday “before the news was public.” “I’m glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,” Vance said in a social media post. “Still much we don’t know, but I’ll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude,” the Ohio senator added. Law enforcement officials found a weapon and other items left behind by the suspect where he was positioned in the bushes near the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. The suspect has not made any statements regarding his involvement in the alleged assassination attempt, said Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. Authorities have not named the suspect. Donald Trump’s campaign office in West Palm Beach, Florida, went into lockdown after shots were fired at his golf course Sunday. There were several staffers in the building at the time, a source familiar told CNN. The lockdown has since lifted.  A man taken into custody after gunshots were fired near former President Donald Trump at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, was “relatively calm” when detained, Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder said Sunday.  “He was not displaying a lot of emotions. Never asked, ‘What is this about?’” the sheriff said.  Snyder said the unnamed suspect was not armed when law enforcement officials took him out of the car. Snyder said the sheriff’s office would take the vehicle to FBI custody, which will take over the investigation, along with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office and the US Secret Service. Snyder said his agency “flooded” Interstate 95 and closed a large swath of the highway before eventually safely stopping the suspect vehicle.  “I have a clear understanding from investigators that we actually do have the suspect that they’re looking for in Palm Beach County,” Snyder said. An FBI representative asked the public to submit any helpful information regarding the security incident investigation via a tip line, 1-800-CALLFBI, or on the FBI’s website. “What we need right now is for the public to avoid the area around the golf course. We will continue support this investigation with the full resources of the FBI,” said Special Agent Jeffrey Veltri of the Miami field office at Sunday’s news conference. A witness saw the suspect later detained in the security incident near former President Donald Trump run from the bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s apprehension, according to the Palm Beach County sheriff. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Sunday that his office was alerted at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the US Secret Service. Authorities were able to get a hit on the vehicle and alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the suspect. The witness was able to then identify the man. Watch: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday that a Secret Service agent was able to spot a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and that the agent “engaged” with the suspect. The gunman was 300 to 500 yards away from former President Donald Trump, a Secret Service official said. The former president was one or two holes behind because the security detail moves ahead to make sure the area is cleared. The agent noticed the rifle barrel sticking out during the advance check, the official said. This post has been updated with additional information. The FBI said Sunday it is responding to West Palm Beach, Florida, and “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of former President Donald Trump. A suspect has been detained by local police after shots were fired at Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach.  Florida Republican Rep. Michael Waltz called for the US Secret Service to brief Congress this week after the security incident near former President Donald Trump. “As I’ve said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing. As a member of the Assassination Task Force, I expect the Secret Service to brief us this week,” he wrote on X. Waltz is a member of a bipartisan congressional task force made up of six Democrats and seven Republicans established to investigate the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13. Former President Donald Trump was moving between holes five and six at his South Florida golf course when the security incident happened Sunday, a source briefed on the matter told CNN.   The suspect, who the Secret Service engaged with, was a number of holes ahead of the former president, according to two law enforcement sources.   The Secret Service fired at the suspect as a protective measure, that source said. Trump was golfing with donor Steve Witkoff when the incident happened, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Former President Donald Trump is in “good spirits” after the security incident that occurred at his golf course earlier Sunday, according to Trump ally Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. of South Carolina. “Just spoke with President Trump. He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known. He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country,” Graham wrote on social media platform X. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance did not address reporters as he boarded his campaign plane Sunday following a security incident involving former President Donald Trump in South Florida. Vance, Trump’s running mate, was boarding the plane at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to return to Washington, DC. One reporter yelled out to ask whether Vance had talked to Trump or heard anything about the shots fired near the former president while he was playing golf. Former President Donald Trump said in a fundraising email that he is “safe and well” following the security incident at his golf course in South Florida earlier Sunday. A suspect who authorities believe is connected to Sunday’s incident at Trump International Golf Course has been taken into custody, according to a Facebook post from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office in Florida. The sheriff’s office “has stopped a vehicle and taken a suspect into custody,” the post said. A section of Interstate 95 near State Route 714 in Martin County is shut down, the office said. “We will update this information as it becomes available,” the post continued. Martin County is north of Palm Beach County, where Sunday’s incident at Trump International took place. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed on the security incident involving former President Donald Trump in Florida Sunday, according to the Department of Justice. DOJ spokesperson Dena Iverson said Garland is monitoring the situation and is receiving regular updates following the security incident at the Trump International Golf Club. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are both “relieved to know” that Donald Trump is safe and have been briefed on the security incident involving the former president while he was golfing earlier Sunday, according to the White House. Biden and Harris, both of whom are in Washington, DC, with no public events today, will be kept updated by their team. “The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing. They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team,” according to a statement from the White House. In her own statement posted on social media Sunday, Harris said, “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.”  This post has been updated with additional information. A person has been detained in connection to the incident at Trump International Golf Club on Sunday, according to a law enforcement source. Secret Service fired at the suspect, according to multiple sources. A long gun has been recovered, according to the source. Officials believe an armed individual intended to target former President Donald Trump at his golf club, according to sources briefed on the matter. Officials believe an armed individual intended to target former President Donald Trump at Trump International Golf Club, according to sources briefed on the matter. A car has been stopped in relation to the incident nearby, according to a law enforcement official. The Secret Service said on X that it is working with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office to investigate a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump. The Secret Service said the incident occurred shortly before 2 p.m. ET. The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office is planning to speak at 3:15 p.m. ET to share more information, spokesperson Teri Barbera told CNN. Former President Donald Trump is safe “following gunshots in his vicinity,” his campaign said Sunday. Trump was playing golf at Trump international Golf Club in West Palm Beach when shots were fired. The course was immediately locked down, according to a source familiar.  As the 2024 campaign enters its final sprint, the candidates are hitting the trail this week, with Vice President Kamala Harris visiting key swing states and former President Donald Trump holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Monday: Trump will introduce a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will deliver remarks at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual dinner. Harris, meanwhile, will attend a roundtable with the Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, as she seeks to win over support from organized labor. Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, while Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. The city of Springfield, Ohio, is going through “a very difficult time,” the mayor said Sunday, adding that it would be helpful if politicians who amplified false rumors about immigrants eating pets in his city “understood the weight of their words.”  Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said city officials, including city commissioners, have received threats for the past three days. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance reiterated the false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of Springfield residents in an interview with Bash earlier Sunday. But he rejected the notion that his rhetoric has led to the bomb threats against city officials, schools, hospitals and universities in Springfield. Rue said he has not heard from Vance directly, “and that’s fine,” but said that he and others propagating the rumors should know that authorities in Springfield are telling the truth. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Sunday criticized GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance for his lack of “partnerships” with local officials, after the Ohio senator continued to spread baseless rumors about migrants eating pets in the state. Moore said Vance emphasizing a handful of constituents and dismissing the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, shows he does not understand the importance local politicians play.  “It just gives a sense about how he views partnership and how he views the intelligence that’s coming from us.” Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday the false claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance, a Republican from Ohio. Rue on Thursday night urged national candidates — a clear reference to Trump and Vance — to “pay attention to what their words are doing to cities like ours.” “We need help, not hate,” Rue said. Kamala Harris’ campaign on Sunday slammed Donald Trump in a statement filled with Taylor Swift song references after the former president expressed hatred for the singer. Trump had posted to his Truth Social platform earlier Sunday, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” The music superstar endorsed Harris after the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday, ending speculation about whether she would share her political views ahead of November’s election. On an August afternoon last year in Washington, Kamala Harris appeared at a retail village to promote the Biden administration’s economic record. “Bidenomics is working,” the vice president announced, touting the latest round of job numbers. “That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics.” The Trump campaign and its allies have spent more than $38 million replaying that soundbite almost 70,000 times in campaign advertisements since Harris became the Democratic nominee, looking to capitalize on persistent voter concerns about the economy and blunt Harris’ turn-the-page messaging by yoking her to President Joe Biden’s record. Throughout the campaign, Trump and his allies have taken a two-track approach to their attacks against Harris — on the one hand linking immigration and crime, and amplifying public safety concerns; while on the other, slamming the Biden-Harris economic record, with a particular focus on inflation. The spree of ads replaying Harris’ endorsement of “Bidenomics” reflects the latter approach, and that share of the pro-Trump messaging has been increasing as the campaign fine-tunes its advertising strategy for the final weeks of the race. Democrats — including Biden and Harris — ditched the “Bidenomics” branding long ago as part of their messaging on the economy. For the vice president, her approach to the issue since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket speaks to the balancing act she has faced when it comes to embracing the administration’s record. Read more here Federal Reserve officials won’t say how former President Donald Trump winning a second term could impact the economy, striving to stay apolitical. But transcripts of closed-door Fed meetings from Trump’s first term, now publicly available, give some clues about top economists’ true feelings about the former president’s economic agenda. “So it seems to me that we may be trading a greater likelihood of a sustained expansion over the next year or two for a greater likelihood of a hard landing later,” Dudley added. A hard landing refers to when the Fed is unable to bring inflation down without causing the economy to enter a recession. Dudley, who is now president of Washington and Lee University, did not respond to CNN’s request for a comment. If voted into office in the November presidential election, Trump has promised to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on all foreign imports, up to 60% for some Chinese products, and levies as high as 100% for countries that abandon the dollar as their reserve currency. If enacted, those policies could have wide-reaching effects on the US economy as well as economies across the globe. The Fed declined to comment to CNN. Read more here Former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Saturday claimed that he’s under investigation for collecting a whale’s specimen nearly two decades ago. Kennedy likely misspoke about the name of the investigating agency, as the National Marine Fisheries Services is an organization that falls under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. CNN has reached out to the agencies for comment. On Saturday, Kennedy claimed he wrote a letter in response, accusing the investigators of killing whales and marine wildlife with “giant offshore wind farms off the East Coast.” A story resurfaced last month that Kennedy once used a chainsaw to cut off the head of a dead whale carcass that washed onshore of his Cape Cod family home and then drove the whale head back to New York. The story was recounted by Kennedy’s daughter Kathleen “Kick” Kennedy in a 2012 interview with Town & Country Magazine. An environmental group, the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, had called for Kennedy to be investigated over the incident, arguing in a letter to NOAA that his actions could have jeopardized scientific research . Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Sunday condemned Republican vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance for refusing to walk back his baseless claims that migrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.   Shapiro’s comments came after Vance defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets earlier Sunday in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash. Officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. Shapiro also told CNN that he anticipates a close race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania but noted that he’s optimistic his state will show up for Harris.  “I think what I’m seeing more and more of is not just the folks who are lining up to vote for her, but those who are enthusiastic about her candidacy in communities that oftentimes are not enthusiastic about Democratic candidates — and encouraging their neighbors to be for them as well,” Shapiro said. “So I’m really hopeful.”  Former President Donald Trump on Sunday continued raising doubts about election integrity and claimed, without evidence, that it was “not possible” for the US Postal Service to properly “run the 2024 Presidential Election.” “The United States Postal Service has admitted that it is a poorly run mess that is experiencing mail loss and delays at a level never seen before. With this being the FACT, how can we possibly be expected to allow or trust the U.S. Postal Service to run the 2024 Presidential Election? It is not possible for them to do so. HELP!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  While election officials have warned that the US Postal Service may delay mail-in voting, citing systemic issues in the postal service as more Americans prepare to cast their ballots by mail, there is no evidence that its “not possible” for the postal service to handle mail-in ballots. Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Sunday flatly denied the false rumor spread by Donald Trump that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Ohio and praised immigrants for their positive influence on the community. “No. Absolutely not,” DeWine said when asked if he’d seen any evidence of the pet-eating rumor, a tale many Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have promoted. “Let me tell you what we do know, though. What we know is that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal,” the governor said on ABC’s “This Week.” “They came to Springfield to work.” DeWine acknowledged the city was having some issues adjusting to the influx of mostly Haitian immigrants through a federal immigration program, but he said they were working to deal with the issues. “When you go from a population of 58,000 and add 15,000 people onto that, you’re going to have some challenges and some problems,” the governor said. “And we’re addressing those. We’re working on those every single day.” But the governor said the Haitian immigrants in Springfield are “positive influences” on the community and “any comment about that otherwise, I think is hurtful and is not helpful to the city of Springfield and the people of Springfield.” Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday said he learned his lesson about speaking for Donald Trump after previously stating the former president would veto a national abortion ban.  “I think that I’ve learned my lesson on speaking for the president before he and I have actually talked about an issue. What he has said at the debate, which is quite explicit, is he doesn’t support a national ban. He thinks it’s ridiculous to talk about vetoing a piece of legislation that isn’t going to come before the president in the first place,” Vance said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” On the debate stage, Trump said that he doesn’t support a national abortion ban, but wouldn’t explicitly say he would veto one, rather that it wouldn’t make it through Congress. “We hadn’t discussed it,” Vance said. “We still haven’t discussed it, by the way, because it’s not realistic.” Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday sought to distance the Trump campaign from far-right agitator Laura Loomer, stating that while he doesn’t agree with her comments about Vice President Kamala Harris, it is not “an issue of national import” or insulting to talk about “dietary preferences.”  Two days before the ABC presidential debate, Loomer said if Harris, whose mother was from India, wins the 2024 election, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Pressed on whether he disavows those comments, especially considering his wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants, Vance said, “I just told you I don’t like those comments, and I think that we ought to focus on Kamala Harris’ policy failures.” When Trump landed in Philadelphia on Tuesday before his debate against Vice Kamala Harris, Loomer was among the close allies seen deboarding his private plane. He said Friday that he doesn’t control Loomer, whom he described as a “free spirit” and “supporter.” Former President Donald Trump on Sunday said he hates Taylor Swift, days after the pop megastar endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Swift endorsed Harris after the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday, ending speculation about whether she would share her political views ahead of November’s election. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift posted on Instagram. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” Swift continued. “The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” Asked about the endorsement on Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump cast Swift as a “very liberal person” and said she will “probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.” Former President Donald Trump has conjured up an inflammatory false claim about Vice President Kamala Harris’ policy positions — baselessly saying Friday that Harris is talking about forcing Americans to serve in the military. Trump claimed at a rally in Las Vegas that voting for Harris means voting for war with Russia and voting to bring back the draft, a system in which some men are conscripted into involuntary service in the armed forces. Trump continued: “Would anybody like to be drafted, in the audience? Because that’s what they’re doing. She’s already talking about bringing back the draft. She wants to bring back the draft, and draft your child, and put them in a war that should never have happened.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris is not talking about bringing back the draft and has not put forward any proposals to bring back the draft. Trump’s campaign did not respond Saturday to CNN’s requests for any evidence for his claim. A Harris campaign aide said, “We have no idea what he’s talking about.” The US has not had a draft since 1973, the year it completed its military withdrawal from Vietnam. (Trump received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War draft, four because he was a college student and a fifth on account of a doctor’s diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels.) Since 1973, the country has used an all-volunteer force. Regardless of the wishes of any president, launching a new draft would require Congress to pass legislation. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Asked to support his claims, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening, though he didn’t provide the evidence.  Bash replied, “You just said that this is a story that you created.” Vance said, “It comes from firsthand accounts from my constituents. I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it. I didn’t create 20,000 illegal migrants coming into Springfield thanks to Kamala Harris’ policies. Her policies did that. But yes, we created the actual focus that allowed the American media to talk about this story and the suffering caused by Kamala Harris’ policies.” The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor about immigrants eating pets. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. On Tuesday, Vance said it’s possible the false claim might not be true, but he encouraged his followers to continue posting “cat memes.” As CNN reported, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday that the claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance.  US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Sunday swiped at former President Donald Trump over the baseless claims he’s pushed that immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating pets. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. Buttigieg continued, “They go for something that is so outrageous that you actually can’t ignore it. The media can’t ignore what’s going on, because very real pain has been inflicted on and fear, by the way, on people in this community and other communities around the country.” Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat-turned-independent who had toyed with a presidential run and has long been a thorn in the side of the left, has been mum about the candidate he’s backing in November. But that could soon change, as Manchin signaled he may get off the sidelines and plans to speak to Vice President Kamala Harris soon. Sen. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee who voted twice to convict former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trials, reiterated his disdain for Trump – and objected to the former president’s refusal to say at last week’s debate that he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia. Asked twice if he could endorse Harris, Romney pointedly refused to say. The comments by Manchin and Romney – two retiring senators who have been on the outs with their respective party’s base – underscore how Trump has turned off some more moderate voters but also how Harris herself has yet to close the deal with right-leaning voters turned off by the former president. A third Trump detractor, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, doesn’t plan to vote for Harris, even as she said of the former president’s debate performance, “I don’t think it was Donald Trump’s best evening.” Read more here. Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, is taking “extreme precautions” in response to an email that threatened an on-campus shooting targeting Haitians on Sunday, according to university officials. The threat comes as several prominent Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. The threat to Wittenberg University “targeted Haitian members of our community,” a statement released Saturday said. “Wittenberg Police are cooperating with the Springfield Police Division and the FBI to investigate this threat.”   All activities have been canceled on Sunday, and the Springfield Police Division will increase patrols on campus, the university’s statement said, adding that those who are on or near campus should “prepare for additional instructions or a lockdown if we learn more from the ongoing investigation.” Wittenberg University had 1,288 undergraduate students enrolled in the fall 2023 term, according to its website. CNN has reached out to the Wittenberg Police Department for additional information.  Donald Trump wanted to spend this week attacking one of Democratic rival Kamala Harris’ biggest political vulnerabilities. Instead, he spent most of the week falsely claiming that migrants are eating pets in a small town in Ohio and defending his embrace of a far-right agitator whose presence is causing concern among his allies. Trump’s repeated parroting of unfounded social media rumors about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating pets stole headlines during a trip West, including stops in Arizona and Nevada, late this week. The promotion of the claims overshadowed a series of speeches aimed at the economy and blaming Harris for border security failures. Trump, in a news conference in California on Friday, promised “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio — the town that has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets. The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Read more here. New polling post-debate from ABC News and Ipsos finds Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump among likely voters, with the margin in the race unchanged from ABC News polling conducted in late August.  Overall, 52% of likely voters back Harris, 46% Trump in the poll, the same margin the pollsters found among likely voters in an August 23 through 27 poll. Among adults, the survey suggests little change in the dynamic between the candidates on the campaign’s central issues. Trump continues to be more widely trusted to handle the economy (46% Trump to 39% Harris) and immigration (47% Trump to 37% Harris), while Harris is broadly more trusted on abortion (48% Harris to 34% Trump) and protecting American democracy (45% Harris to 38% Trump). The ABC News poll was conducted online Sept. 11-13 among a random national sample of 3,276 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 points. For results among the 2,196 likely voters, the error margin is plus or minus 2 points. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and Nebraska Democratic officials are keeping a close eye on any last-minute efforts to change the election law that awards the state’s electoral votes by congressional district, rather than statewide winner. Nebraska’s unique law presents an opportunity for Democrats to secure one of the state’s votes by winning the district surrounding Omaha — a critical blue dot in a sea of red. The state’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen made it clear Friday that he is willing to call a special legislative session on changing the state to a “winner takes all” model before the November election — but said in a statement that he doesn’t yet have “concrete and public indication” that enough lawmakers would back the move. Nebraska Democratic chairwoman Jane Kleeb said Saturday that Pillen’s statement signals Republicans “do not have the votes to change the fair electoral system we have in Nebraska.” When the matter of changing the law came up for a vote in the state legislature earlier this year, it was 17 votes shy of passing. Kleeb said Saturday that those 17 votes remain “very solid.” Bottom line: If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot vote in Nebraska, she can likely reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. That means a potential change to the law — which would be a shocking development so close to the election — could have serious implications for each presidential campaign. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz made a direct pitch to Muslim and Arab American voters in Michigan, addressing those concerned about the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. The Minnesota governor used an interview Friday to reiterate Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and argued Trump’s record of targeting Muslim Americans is “not in your best interest.” Harris is more cognizant of the suffering of Palestinians than Trump, Walz said in the interview with WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan, addressing those from the “Abandon Harris” movement. Illustrating the constant balancing act for the Democratic ticket on the Middle East, Walz also emphasized the importance of Israel’s self-defense. “That’s why she’s the person to move us toward a two-state solution, where Israel can be protected, we get our hostages back, and Gaza can be self-determined,” he added. Walz contrasted Harris’ view with Trump’s previous support of a travel ban that targeted people from Muslim-majority countries, and his calls to send some Muslim members of Congress to their countries of origin. “Donald Trump is offering you nothing,” Walz said, to voters skeptical of Harris over the issue. “That is not in your best interest.”"
Trump lashes out at Nasdaq over routine trading halt of Truth Social | CNN Business,"Updated 3:02 PM EDT, Sat September 14, 2024",2024-09-14T14:31:27.739Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/14/media/truth-social-trump-nasdaq/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump lashed out at Nasdaq over a routine trading halt in shares of his social media company and even threatened to move the listing to the New York Stock Exchange. “Why is NASDAQ halting the sale of DJT?” Trump said Friday on Truth Social, referring to the ticker symbol of Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group. “What right do they have to do this? They have done it twice today. What’s going on?” Trump suggested Nasdaq was “taking orders from the SEC,” an agency he accused of delaying Trump Media’s merger “for political reasons.” What happened is Trump Media’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq Composite, skyrocketed on Friday, after Trump himself made very big news: He announced he won’t be selling shares in the company. That spike was so big that it triggered two five-minute trading pauses designed to provide a cooling period. Such trading halts are routine and happen dozens of times a day for various stocks. For Trump Media (DJT), the first halt occurred at 2:26 p.m. ET and was lifted at 2:31 p.m. ET, according to Nasdaq’s website. That was just minutes after Trump announced during a press conference he is “not selling” shares in the company. That comment lifted the stock 25%. The stock resumed trading before it was halted again at 2:34 p.m. ET for another five-minute halt. A Nasdaq spokesperson told CNN on Saturday that “single-stock trading pauses, also known as ‘Limit up/Limit down,’ are SEC-mandated market-wide mechanisms deployed across all US exchanges, designed to protect both companies and investors and minimize excess volatility in a single stock or the wider market.” Joe Saluzzi, a market structure expert and co-founder of Themis Trading, told CNN in an email Saturday that “these types of halts are very common” and noted that such halts are mandated by federal regulators and have been in place since 2013 across the entire US exchange listed stock market. “So, Mr. Trump’s threat about moving his stock from Nasdaq to NYSE would have no effect since both Nasdaq and NYSE both follow the same SEC rules,” he said. Even though all of this appeared to be routine, Trump threatened to punish Nasdaq. “I am going to hold NASDAQ, and maybe the SEC, liable for doing what they are doing,” he said in his Truth Social post. “If they do it again, we will move the stock to the New York Stock Exchange.” Nasdaq did not respond to CNN’s request for comment."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris warned Saturday that a second term for former President Donald Trump poses a “profound threat” to the vision of the nation. While delivering remarks at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Awards Dinner, Harris claimed Trump and his allies “intend to take our nation backward.”   Harris railed against the former president’s policies, criticizing his inability to outline his plans for health care during Tuesday night’s debate. She touted her plans to build intergenerational wealth, her economic agenda, and her determination to fight for reproductive freedoms, telling the CBC, “When you pass a bill to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.” Harris also emphasized the stakes of the election, telling attendees, “The baton is in our hands.” ##Harris## President Joe Biden on Saturday slammed former President Donald Trump for his divisive rhetoric and conspiracy theories while praising Vice President Kamala Harris and telling Black Americans to “keep the faith.” Speaking at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Awards, where he received a lifetime achievement award, Biden touted his legacy and looked ahead to the election. Biden specifically responded to the false rumor spread by the Trump campaign that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are stealing and eating people’s pets. “He says immigrants, Black and brown immigrants, poison the blood of our country. Right now, his running mate is attacking Haitian Americans in Ohio. It’s wrong,” Biden said. The president touted his accomplishments in lowering health care costs, his efforts to forgive student debt, his climate actions and his appointment of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Biden stressed that “we have work to do” in the limited time before the election. “So, my challenge to you is to keep the faith. Do the work, because we know faith without works is dead,” he said. While introducing Harris, Biden called his vice president “the best decision I’ve made.” Former President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would make up the lost tax revenue from his tax proposals with increased funds from drilling and by imposing tariffs on foreign nations. Trump has proposed eliminating taxes on tips, ending taxes on overtime pay and cutting income taxes on Social Security benefits. When asked in an interview with Las Vegas TV station KNTV how he plans to replace decreased revenue from the federal budget, Trump said, “Drill, baby drill.” Trump defended his tariffs plan when asked whether he believes the levies would cause prices to increase and wipe out any advantage from his tax proposals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz questioned why working-class voters might support former President Donald Trump during a rally in Superior, Wisconsin, on Saturday, while relating to fellow Democrats in exasperation over “friends, neighbors, family” who support Trump’s policy proposals. The Democratic vice presidential nominee, whose brother and distant cousins have expressed support for Trump, laid out conversations he’s had with voters about why they support the Republican nominee. Walz’s comments come as the Harris campaign is aggressively courting independent and Republican-leaning voters in rural areas, including places like northwest Wisconsin, where the governor spoke Saturday. Walz also repeatedly stressed in his remarks the importance of bringing Vice President Kamala Harris’ message to Republican voters. His trip to Superior marks the end of his first solo swing through Michigan and Wisconsin as the Democratic vice presidential candidate. The town sits in a county President Joe Biden won by 9 points in 2020, but borders rural counties where the campaign is hoping to cut into Trump’s margins. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance criticized the federal immigration parole program that allows Haitian immigrants to be in Springfield, Ohio, legally, arguing that “only people who actually enrich” the country should be here. Vance’s response was to a question about the potential backlash immigrants are facing after his recent false claims about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield. Local officials have repeatedly said there are no credible claims about such animal abuse, and following the evacuation of two schools and a bomb threat on the city hall, the city’s mayor urged former President Donald Trump and Vance “to pay attention” to the impact of their rhetoric. Vance on Saturday also criticized the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration policies, which include the immigration parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the US, according to the city of Springfield’s website. The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who all condemned far-right agitator Laura Loomer’s racist comments and expressed concern about her ties to former President Donald Trump, issued a joint statement Saturday saying they are glad “Trump has made clear he disavows Laura Loomer’s offensive comments.” But at a Friday news conference, Trump didn’t make it exactly clear he condemns Loomer’s comments. In response to questions about Loomer’s racist and conspiratorial statements, Trump said that he had just heard about them and that Loomer was a person with “strong opinions.” “I do know that she may have said something based on what you’re telling me, but I don’t know what she said, but I’ll go take a look and I’ll put out a statement later on,” Trump said.  When asked by CNN’s Kristen Holmes about his allies expressing concerns, Trump said, “Laura’s been a supporter of mine, just like a lot of people are supporters, and she’s been a supporter of mine. She speaks very positively of the campaign. … I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit.” Later on Truth Social, Trump said he disagreed “with the statements” Loomer made but didn’t specify which statements.  Vice President Kamala Harris told donors at a fundraiser in Washington, DC, on Saturday that the contrast with former President Donald Trump was “very clear” on the debate stage this week. In the days following the debate, Harris has repeatedly blasted the former president for his performance. She criticized him Saturday for having “no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people” before hitting him on policy issues including his promise to replace the Affordable Care Act without offering a plan to do so. “So he’s saying that again, that he wants to replace it. And then remember what he said about how he’s going to do it? You guys watched the debate. Concepts of a plan. That’s right. Concepts of a plan. No actual plan,” she said. Harris reminded donors of the stakes of the election, telling them the “clock is ticking” with only 52 days until Election Day and urging them to volunteer and mobilize their friends to vote.  Donald Trump said Saturday that Springfield, Ohio, has “been taken over by illegal migrants,” and that he doesn’t know about the bomb threats the town has been receiving since he and other Republicans spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets there. Some context: The claim went viral a few weeks ago and has been promoted by prominent national-level Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Local officials have repeatedly tried to end the rumor, and the city has said there are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” As CNN reported, Springfield City Hall was forced to close due to a bomb threat on Thursday. Two elementary schools were also evacuated Friday “based on information received from the Springfield Police Division,” the city’s school district said. Trump said Friday that the “real threat is what’s happening at our border” rather than the bomb threats in Springfield.  The city notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the US. Trump’s remarks Saturday were the latest in a string of inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants this week. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance stopped by Sup Dog, a bar in downtown Greenville, North Carolina, ahead of the East Carolina v. Appalachian State football game, which Vance is attending. With music blasting on the outdoor patio, the Ohio senator walked up with a drink in his hand and sat down at a picnic table with three young men. Vance, who was joined by his wife, Usha, made his way to different tables, greeting people, chatting and taking photos.  “Remember to vote November, right,” Vance told a group of people. “Y’all going to the game or are you just here to drink?” One of the men asked, “Any chance you want to get drinks at the bar?” Vance laughed and said he already had one. “If I take shots all of these reporters will cover it negatively, so I can’t do it,” Vance joked. Pigskin politics: Last week, the Democratic National Committee flew planes over college football games in Midwestern battleground states featuring banners linking Vance and his running mate, former President Donald Trump, to the controversial conservative policy platform Project 2025. Trump has previously enjoyed warm welcomes at red state college games. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and Nebraska Democratic officials are keeping a close eye on any last-minute efforts to change the election law that awards the state’s electoral votes by congressional district, rather than statewide winner. Nebraska’s unique law presents an opportunity for Democrats to secure one of the state’s votes by winning the district surrounding Omaha — a critical blue dot in a sea of red. The state’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen made it clear Friday that he is willing to call a special legislative session on changing the state to a “winner takes all” model before the November election — but said in a statement that he doesn’t yet have “concrete and public indication” that enough lawmakers would back the move. Nebraska Democratic chairwoman Jane Kleeb said Saturday that Pillen’s statement signals Republicans “do not have the votes to change the fair electoral system we have in Nebraska.” When the matter of changing the law came up for a vote in the state legislature earlier this year, it was 17 votes shy of passing. Kleeb said Saturday that those 17 votes remain “very solid.” Why this is so important: If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot vote in Nebraska, she can likely reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. Prominent GOP backer: Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who has led a rallying cry in favor of changing the election law, is returning to the state Saturday to appear at a GOP tailgate party before a Nebraska football game. Kleeb dismissed Kirk’s involvement in the state as “bullying and bluster.” Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz made a direct pitch to Muslim and Arab American voters in Michigan, addressing those concerned about the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. The Minnesota governor used an interview Friday to reiterate Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and argued Trump’s record of targeting Muslim Americans is “not in your best interest.” Harris is more cognizant of the suffering of Palestinians than Trump, Walz said in the interview with WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan, addressing those from the “Abandon Harris” movement. Illustrating the constant balancing act for the Democratic ticket on the Middle East, Walz also emphasized the importance of Israel’s self-defense. “That’s why she’s the person to move us toward a two-state solution, where Israel can be protected, we get our hostages back, and Gaza can be self-determined,” he added. Walz contrasted Harris’ view with Trump’s previous support of a travel ban that targeted people from Muslim-majority countries, and his calls to send some Muslim members of Congress to their countries of origin. “Donald Trump is offering you nothing,” Walz said, to voters skeptical of Harris over the issue. “That is not in your best interest.” A social media account run by Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has been repeatedly deceptive. The campaign deploys the @KamalaHQ account as a kind of irreverent attack dog, using jocular posts to draw attention to controversial, incorrect or dubious comments by Trump and his allies. But the account, which the Harris campaign calls its “official rapid response page,” has itself made inaccurate comments on multiple occasions. In one example, an August 17 post from @KamalaHQ strongly suggested Trump had gotten confused about what state he was in during an event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The post said, “Trump: Would that be okay, North Carolina? (He is in Pennsylvania).” It included a six-second video clip in which Trump said, while pointing to his left, “Would that be OK, North Carolina? I don’t think so, right.” The Harris campaign was explicit about its intentions in the version of the post it made on the Instagram @KamalaHQ account, saying, “Donald Trump is lost and confused.” But Trump was not lost or confused. The full video of the rally shows that earlier in the speech he had pointed to the same part of the crowd to acknowledge a group of ardent supporters from North Carolina. Later, in the moment shown by @KamalaHQ, he pointed to these supporters again and referred to them as “North Carolina.” On Thursday, the @KamalaHQ account made a new attempt to suggest that Trump was confused about his location, but again left out key context. Read about that post and six more examples in the full fact check. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will make campaign stops in Georgia and North Carolina on Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign announced Saturday.  The Democratic vice presidential nominee will speak at an event in Macon, Georgia, in the morning before making stops in Atlanta later in the day, the campaign said. In the evening he’ll fly to Asheville, North Carolina, where he’ll speak at a campaign rally.  The trip marks Walz’s first solo visit to Georgia and his second solo trip to North Carolina since becoming Harris’ running mate. Both states are among the key battlegrounds expected to determine the 2024 presidential election. Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick on Saturday condemned former President Donald Trump’s false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and warned that his rhetoric could spark violence against immigrants.  “My first reaction was just pure disgust and disdain,” the Florida congresswoman and House Haiti Caucus co-chair said Saturday on CNN’s “First of All with Victor Blackwell.” “For him to say that they’re actually committing crimes and stealing pets is a big lie.”  Cherfilus-McCormick is the only Haitian American currently serving in Congress and says she’s “absolutely” concerned that immigrants will get hurt if Trump continues with this inflammatory message. “We’re feeling the combativeness, we’re feeling the death threats,” the lawmaker said, adding that she’s “hearing that from people all across the country.” Remember: Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, continue to promote false claims that Haitian immigrants are killing and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. The rumor appears to have started on a local Facebook group for the community, which has seen an influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian immigrants under the Immigration Parole Program, and has been amplified by right-wing voices as part of their broader anti-immigrant messaging. At a rally Friday, Trump ramped up his rhetoric about immigrants, also doubling down on false claims that Venezuelan gangs were “taking over” Aurora, Colorado.  CNN’s Omar Jimenez contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a wave of new efforts targeting Latino voters during Hispanic Heritage Month to mobilize the key demographic in battleground states. Part of its outreach includes a $3 million investment into Spanish-language radio for September, which the campaign said is among the largest investments into Hispanic media ever. The investment consists of engagements with influential radio personalities, sports-themed creative and advertising during local baseball, football, and soccer team coverage.  The campaign also released a new ad on Friday titled, “My Voice,” featuring Victor Martinez, an Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Lehigh Valley host of La Mega Radio who highlighted Harris’ efforts to lower costs for Latino working families. Throughout the month, surrogates will be deployed to events, including Saturday night’s fight between world champion boxer Canelo Alvarez and Edgar Berlanga, Mexican Independence Day celebrations, and the Detroit Tigers Hispanic Heritage Tailgate. Additionally, organizers will focus on an aggressive push of bilingual phone banking, in-person organizing events and training to help reach the constituency.  Harris is also set to deliver remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual conference on Wednesday. Republicans haven’t given up on turning Nebraska’s blue dot red. Republican Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement Friday that he’s prepared to call a special session of the Nebraska legislature before the November election to change the state law that awards electoral votes by congressional district, rather than awarding all of them to the statewide winner. But, Pillen said, he would only do so if there was sufficient support from state lawmakers. Pillen’s statement underscores his willingness to change state law — an extraordinary move, given the election is less than two months away — but only if Republicans could persuade 33 senators to change their mind and support the bill. So far, support for a switch to the “winner takes all” format has been a few votes short. Key context: Omaha’s blue dot refers to Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District and its single electoral vote, which is considered competitive for Democrats in the otherwise red state, thanks to the current system of awarding electoral votes proportionally. If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot, she can reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. Nebraska and Maine are the only two states that award electoral votes by congressional district, rather than by statewide winner. Barack Obama in 2008 and Joe Biden in 2020 are the Democratic Party’s only two candidates to reap a single electoral vote reward. The effort to change the law now signals concern by Republicans that Trump is struggling to win the district. The Harris campaign is spending millions to win there. Signs with a blue dot have been appearing on yards across Omaha in recent weeks. Here’s a look at what the 2024 presidential campaigns are up to on Saturday: Harris: Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to make remarks this afternoon at a fundraiser in Washington, DC, that will not be open the media. Harris is then expected to attend the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Award Gala dinner in DC on Saturday evening, where she and President Joe Biden will deliver remarks. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff is also expected to attend. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will speak this afternoon at a campaign rally in Superior, Wisconsin.   Trump: Former President Donald Trump remains in Nevada for an event today in Las Vegas. His running mate Sen. JD Vance is expected to attend the Appalachian State vs. East Carolina college football game in Greenville, North Carolina, which kicks off at 4 p.m. ET. Former President Donald Trump said at a rally Friday that if he’s reelected, he will deploy federal law enforcement officials to “liberate parts of our country,” as he continued to claim without evidence that Venezuelan gangs were taking over parts of Colorado. Trump’s comments were part of a series of remarks this week ramping up his rhetoric and stoking fears about both undocumented immigrants and migrants who have entered the country legally. Trump said he would launch a special task force to address organized crime and foreign gangs, which he said are “conquering” the country. Some context: Trump was referencing rumors that Venezuelan gangs are “taking over” buildings in Aurora, Colorado, which have been amplified by Republicans as another flashpoint in the debate over immigration. Police in the Colorado community say Venezuelan gangs are present there, but their influence is “isolated” and has been “overstated.” Here’s a closer look at what’s going on in Aurora. More from Trump: The former president also claimed without evidence that armed undocumented immigrants are “taking over our country from within.” Trump also used the rally to further amplify debunked social media rumors about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating pets. Former President Donald Trump on Friday promoted a baseless claim circulating on right-wing social media that Kamala Harris wore an earpiece at Tuesday’s ABC presidential debate and again baselessly suggested that the vice president received the debate questions in advance.  The conspiracy theory about the earpiece has been promoted by far-right agitator Laura Loomer, who has traveled with Trump in recent days. “Interesting choice of earrings tonight, @KamalaHarris…” Loomer posted Wednesday on social media, including a screenshot of an article about “audio earrings.” As CNN previously reported, several people close to Trump say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories the former president has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the ABC debate was “rigged,” and he has previously baselessly suggested that Harris was provided the questions in advance. The former president said this week that he won’t participate in another debate, while Harris has called for another face-off. Trump suggested Friday, though, that he may change his mind about another debate. President Joe Biden criticized former President Donald Trump’s recent disparagement of Haitian migrants during a Black Excellence brunch hosted at the White House on Friday.  Biden condemned the false claim promoted by Trump at this week’s presidential debate that Haitian immigrants are stealing and eating other people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. Other high-level Republicans, including vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, have propagated the lie. Trump’s debunked claims: Trump has pledged “large deportations” from Springfield, which has become a political flashpoint as Republicans spread the false claims about migrants in the Ohio community. Springfield has had an influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian immigrants, who are in the US legally under the Immigration Parole Program. The unsubstantiated claims about animals being harmed in the community appear to be the result of an unwieldy game of telephone that began as a rumor in a local Facebook group before spiraling to reach the highest echelons of conservative media and the Republican Party. City officials have said there are no credible or specific claims of pets being harmed by immigrants in the community. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday continued to draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump as she seized on post-debate momentum in Pennsylvania.  Harris again slammed his debate performance, calling it a “tired playbook,” while claiming he failed to address the needs of Americans. “Well, folks, it’s time to turn the page. Let’s turn the page… And we are not going back, because America is ready for a new way forward,” she said. The vice president stressed the importance of small businesses and she repeatedly hit her opponent on his economic agenda, including attacking Trump for suggesting he only has “concepts of a plan” to end the Affordable Care Act, but not laying out how he would replace it. While touting her economic own plan, Harris also focused part of her message on job opportunities that don’t require 4-year degrees. Harris’ visited Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre on Friday, both in counties that Trump won in 2016 and 2020."
How a false rumor about pets in Ohio and Laura Loomer’s presence helped derail Trump’s planned attacks on Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:17 PM EDT, Sat September 14, 2024",2024-09-14T09:00:19.572Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/14/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-laura-loomer/index.html,"Donald Trump wanted to spend this week attacking one of Democratic rival Kamala Harris’ biggest political vulnerabilities. Instead, he spent most of the week falsely claiming that migrants are eating pets in a small town in Ohio and defending his embrace of a far-right agitator whose presence is causing concern among his allies. Trump’s repeated parroting of unfounded social media rumors about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating pets stole headlines during a trip West, including stops in Arizona and Nevada, late this week. The promotion of the claims overshadowed a series of speeches aimed at the economy and blaming Harris for border security failures. Trump, in a news conference in California on Friday, promised “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio — the town that has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets. The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Trump also pointed to a Venezuelan gang in Aurora, Colorado. Continuing to use dehumanizing language to describe undocumented immigrants, Trump said “nests of bad people” are being emptied into the United States. “It’s like an invasion from within, and we’re going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country. And we’re going to start with Springfield and Aurora.” “The people of Ohio are scared,” he said. “It’s going to get worse. It’s going to get so bad. You know what we’re experiencing now is they’re just getting settled in.” Trump reiterated the same themes later Friday at a rally in Las Vegas. “We are under invasion just like it was an army, except in many ways it’s more difficult because they don’t wear a uniform, you don’t know who the hell to go after,” he said. Again bringing up both Springfield and Aurora, Trump continued, “I am your border president. From now on I want to be your border president.” Republicans broadly believe that immigration and border security are a top political issue for the party — and one they can use to hammer Harris, who they have labeled President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” That label stems from Biden asking the vice president in 2021 to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. However, during Tuesday’s debate, Trump’s attacks on Harris over immigration veered into the outrageous, as he falsely claimed that migrants are eating dogs and cats in Springfield. Trump’s remarks were met with a sharp condemnation from Biden. “It’s simply wrong. And there’s no place in America. This has to stop — what he’s doing — has to stop,” Biden said during a Black Excellence Brunch hosted at the White House on Friday. The city hall in Springfield was forced to close due to a bomb threat on Thursday. Two elementary schools were evacuated Friday “based on information received from the Springfield Police Division,” the Springfield City School District announced Friday. Two local hospitals — Kettering Health and Mercy Health Springfield Regional Medical Center — were also forced into lockdown due to bomb threats Saturday, according to statements sent to CNN. Springfield police said they received two calls Saturday about a Proud Boys presence in the city. A video circulating on social media shows a group of approximately 15 to 20 individuals, some of whom are carrying flags and wearing clothing with logos associated with the far-right Proud Boys, marching in the city. Police told CNN that when officers went to the area, the group was no longer there. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue on Thursday night urged national candidates — a clear reference to Trump and Vance — to “pay attention to what their words are doing to cities like ours.” “We need help, not hate,” Rue said. Trump dismissed those concerns on Friday, and again on Saturday when asked whether he denounced the threats in Springfield. “I don’t know what happened with the, uh, bomb threats,” Trump said during a visit to the Las Vegas Police Protective Association on Saturday. “I know that (Springfield has) been taken over by illegal migrants, and that’s a terrible thing that happened.” Even Pope Francis on Friday sharply criticized Trump over his position on immigration, while also lambasting Harris for her support for abortion rights. “To send migrants away, to leave them wherever you want, to leave them … it’s something terrible, there is evil there. To send away a child from the womb of the mother is an assassination, because there is life. We must speak about these things clearly,” the pope said. Vance, Trump’s running mate, argued that Trump’s comments ignited conversation about immigration — even as he acknowledged on X the flimsiness of the rumors that ignited the story. On Tuesday, Vance posted, “It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.” But the veracity of the claims did not seem to be his top concern. “Don’t let biased media shame you into not discussing this slow moving humanitarian crisis in a small Ohio town. We should talk about it every single day. Kamala Harris did this. And she’ll keep doing it unless we stop her,” he posted on X on Friday. The claim of pets being eaten in Ohio was not the only eyebrow raising moment from this week that has put the focus on the former president’s campaign. Trump has been spending time with far-right agitator Laura Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack and shared racist comments on social media attacking Harris. Several people close to the former president say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories Trump has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket, a change that has left the GOP nominee increasingly unsettled by the political landscape he now faces. Trump on Friday described Loomer as a “free spirit” and “supporter.” “She’s a strong person. She’s got strong opinions, and I don’t know what she said, but that’s not up to me. She’s a supporter,” Trump said. Democratic National Committee rapid response director Alex Floyd on Friday highlighted Trump’s relationship with Loomer and other controversial allies. He said those surrounding Trump are “as professional as you’d expect for a convicted fraudster.” Trump and Harris were back on the campaign trail late this week after a Tuesday night debate that 63% of viewers said Harris won over Trump’s 37%, according to a CNN poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS.  The former president’s trip West came as Harris campaigned in Pennsylvania — the largest battleground of the 2024 election, with 19 Electoral College votes up for grabs. Combined, the commonwealth has already seen $175 million spent on television ads — more than $93 million by Democrats and more than $81 million by Republicans, according to AdImpact data. Another $136 million, including nearly $77 million by Democrats and $59 million by Republicans, has been booked between Saturday and Election Day. That’s more than has been spent, or reserved, in any other state. Harris needs strong turnout in Democratic strongholds such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but also to minimize Trump’s margins as much as possible in red parts of the state. Her visit Friday focused on two counties Trump won during both of his White House bids — Cambria and Luzerne. “Ultimately, I feel very strongly that we have to earn every vote and that means spending time with folks in the community where they live. That’s why I’m here. We’re going to be spending a lot more time in Pennsylvania,” Harris told reporters at a bookstore in Johnstown on Friday. This story has been updated with additional developments."
Fox News and right-wing media ignore Trump’s embrace of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer | CNN Business,"Updated 8:48 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T21:55:28.658Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/media/fox-news-right-wing-media-trump-laura-loomer/index.html,"Right-wing media outlets are ignoring Donald Trump’s embrace of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, shielding their audience from the uproar amid condemnation from top Republicans. In recent days, Donald Trump has mingled with Loomer, the radical conspiracy theorist who has a well-documented history of pushing racist, sexist, Islamophobic and homophobic hate. Loomer has been banned from most social media platforms for her vile rhetoric, though her account was restored in 2022 on X after Elon Musk, himself an avid Trump supporter, purchased the platform. Loomer’s presence with Trump at this week’s presidential debate and 9/11 memorial ceremonies has drawn widespread attention from mainstream news outlets, with major publications and television outlets spotlighting her appearance with the former president. The move has also ignited public condemnation and disgust even among those in his own party. But right-wing media outlets have largely ignored her close proximity to Trump and the ensuing controversy. On Fox News, the network mentioned Loomer’s presence just once since she was first seen deboarding Trump’s private plane on Tuesday at the Philadelphia debate, according to TVEyes database searches. [After this story was published and CNN had reached out to Fox News, the network aired a 26-second segment on the matter during “Special Report” with Bret Baier.] A check of the right-wing network’s website also showed zero mentions of Loomer this week. That was also the case in other pro-Trump outlets, including the websites of Breitbart, The Daily Wire, One America News, and The Gateway Pundit. It’s not the first time Fox and other friendly pro-Trump spaces have outright ignored or distracted their audience from an unflattering story facing Trump. Earlier this year, when former Vice President Mike Pence announced during a live Fox News interview that he “cannot in good conscience” endorse Trump’s latest bid for the White House, the network quickly buried its own scoop. According to the progressive media watchdog Media Matters, Fox News devoted just four minutes to the news over the ensuing three-day period, compared to more than an hour on CNN and MSNBC. In effect, Fox and its right-wing media counterparts insulate their conservative audience from events that might dim their perception of Trump, and instead offers viewers a safe space where their existing beliefs are reinforced by sympathetic hosts and guests. Still, some of Trump’s allies in the Republican party expressed outrage over Loomer’s recent rhetoric as she was seen traveling with the former president. “The history of statements by Ms. Loomer are beyond disturbing,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told The Washington Post on Thursday. “I hope this problem gets resolved. I think we should be talking about things that people are concerned about, and this issue, I think, doesn’t help the cause.” GOP Sen. Thom Tillis also posted on social media that Loomer is “a crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage intended to divide Republicans. A DNC plant couldn’t do a better job than she is doing to hurt President Trump’s chances of winning re-election. Enough.” It was a bridge too far even for Rep.Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman known to promote conspiracy theories, who wrote on social media that Loomer’s post was “appalling and extremely racist.” She added: “It does not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA.” Asked about the controversy on Friday, Trump refused to disavow Loomer, saying that he doesn’t control her. “Laura’s been a supporter of mine, just like a lot of people are supporters, and she’s been a supporter of mine,” Trump said. “She speaks very positively of the campaign. I’m not sure why you asked that question, but Laura is a supporter. I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit.”"
Trump’s social media stock explodes higher after Donald Trump says he’s not selling | CNN Business,"Updated 3:07 PM EDT, Sat September 14, 2024",2024-09-13T18:57:25.460Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/investing/trump-social-media-stock/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump said Friday that he is not selling shares in his controversial social media company, an announcement that sent the stock prices skyrocketing. Trump and other insiders in Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group will be free to sell shares as soon as next week when lock-up restrictions are set to expire. “No, I’m not selling. No, I love it,” Trump said during a press conference in response to a question from a reporter. Trump’s comments instantly sent the volatile company’s share price spiking 25% on Friday afternoon before trading was halted for volatility. In late afternoon trading, Trump Media was up 19%. “People think that I’m leaving. That’s why they’re down, ‘cause it’s different if I leave. But I’m not leaving,” Trump said. Regulatory filings indicate the lock-up period will expire as soon as the closing bell on September 19 if the closing share price remains above $12. That would allow Trump to sell shares, although experts caution that it would be nearly impossible for him to dump all or even most of his stock without crashing the share price. It’s not clear if Trump is ruling out selling even a smaller piece of the company. Trump is the dominant shareholder in the Trump Media, owning 57% of the outstanding shares. His stake of 114.75 million was valued at $1.8 billion based on Thursday’s closing price. Trump Media’s value plunged sharply in recent months because of a combination of concerns about the expiring lock-up restriction and in response to polls indicating a close race for the White House. The stock tumbled to record lows earlier this week after the former president’s shaky performance in Tuesday night’s debate."

She’s a free spirit,” Trump said at a news conference in Southern California in response to a question from CNN’s Kristen Holmes about his allies expressing concern about their close relationship in recent days. Pressed by Holmes that it’s his allies who have expressed concern, Trump said, “Look, I can’t tell Laura what to do. Laura’s a supporter. I have a lot of supporters.” Hours later, Trump sought to distance himself from Loomer, who for years has pushed baseless conspiracy theories and posted racist content online, writing in a Truth Social post that he disagreed with some of her statements, though he did not specify which ones. “Laura Loomer doesn’t work for the Campaign. She’s a private citizen and longtime supporter. I disagree with the statements she made but, like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the Radical Left Marxists and Fascists violently attack and smear me, even to the point of doing anything to stop their Political Opponent, ME!” Trump wrote. Loomer has made a career out of courting controversy. Rising out of the radical right-wing online ecosystem, she has regularly tested the willingness of internet companies to enforce their terms of service. She once described herself as a “proud Islamophobe” and tweeted in 2018 that “someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver.” She was eventually banned from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Loomer told CNN she is not “anti-Muslim.” Last year, she posted a video on social media claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an “inside job,” an illogical but pervasive conspiracy theory that continues to haunt the families of victims and survivors. She twice ran for Congress in her home state of Florida, including once to represent Trump’s home in Mar-a-Lago, almost exclusively campaigning on her allegiance to the former president. She lost both races. The former president has long embraced conspiracy theories and has regularly aligned himself with those who peddle in them, especially if they support him. He entered the political arena as one of the leading purveyors of myths about President Barack Obama’s birthplace. And after he lost the 2020 election, Trump surrounded himself with people who claimed with questionable or debunked evidence they could prove he won. But several people close to the former president say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories Trump has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket, a change that has left the GOP nominee increasingly unsettled by the political landscape he now faces. Speaking at a rally in Las Vegas later Friday, Trump echoed the baseless claim promoted by Loomer that Vice President Kamala Harris wore an earpiece at their debate Tuesday. “I also heard she had something in the ear, a little something in the ear: ‘No, Kamala, do this. Say it this way, Kamala. OK, be quiet, too many people watching,’” he said. Two days before the debate, Loomer said that if Harris, who is half Indian, wins the 2024 election, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” In response to questions about Loomer’s racist and conspiratorial comments, Trump said earlier Friday that he had just heard about it for the first time, and that Loomer was a person with “strong opinions.” “She’s a strong person. She’s got strong opinions, and I don’t know what she said, but that’s not up to me. She’s a supporter,” Trump said. “I do know that she may have said something based on what you’re telling me, but I don’t know what she said, but I’ll go take a look and I’ll put out a statement later on.” Trump ally and conservative Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene condemned the remark, calling it “appalling and extremely racist.” When Trump landed in Philadelphia on Tuesday before his debate against Harris, Loomer was among the close allies seen deboarding his private plane. Some saw it as no coincidence that hours later, an erratic Trump exclaimed from the debate stage that immigrants were “eating the pets” of Ohioans, referencing a fast-escalating rumor about Haitian migrants circulated this week by the online right, including Loomer. Trump’s own running mate, Sen. JD Vance, had spread that false claim before acknowledging on Tuesday that it may not be true. On Friday, Trump said the “real threat is what’s happening at our border” when asked about bomb threats in Springfield, Ohio, and schools being evacuated as he and his Republican allies spread the debunked conspiracy theory. Trump said earlier in the press conference that “maybe” he would hold a campaign event in Springfield. In response to another reporter’s question, Trump downplayed how Loomer traveled with him on his plane to the Philadelphia debate along with close advisers and family members. “A lot of people do. It’s a very big plane,” Trump said. This story has been updated with additional developments. CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed to this report."
"Pope Francis criticizes Trump and Harris, says voters must choose between ‘lesser of two evils’ | CNN Politics","Updated 4:17 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T17:53:55.179Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/pope-francis-trump-harris-abortion/index.html,"Pope Francis on Friday described the choice US voters must make in the presidential election as one between the “lesser of two evils,” deeming former President Donald Trump’s anti-migrant policies and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights as both being “against life.” “One must choose the lesser of two evils. Who is the lesser of two evils? That lady or that gentleman? I don’t know,” Francis said during a press conference on the papal plane, referring to Harris and Trump. “Everyone with a conscience should think on this and do it.” Francis has been more vocal about politics than his predecessors and has moved to make the Catholic Church more open. While he has consistently and strongly defended the Catholic Church’s teaching that abortion is the deliberate destruction of a human life, Francis has also insisted it cannot be isolated from other issues concerning human life, including immigration. “To send migrants away, to leave them wherever you want, to leave them … it’s something terrible, there is evil there. To send away a child from the womb of the mother is an assassination, because there is life. We must speak about these things clearly,” he said. Francis has previously weighed in on political issues, signaling more progressive stances by allowing priests to forgive abortions, authorizing blessings for same-sex couples and repeatedly warning about climate change. He has challenged Catholic bishops in the US who have insisted that abortion is the “pre-eminent” issue, arguing that the plight of migrants is also about the defense of life. In 2016, Francis described then-presidential candidate Trump’s plan to build a wall to stop migrants from crossing the US-Mexico border as “not Christian.” And when bishops were debating in 2021 whether to deny communion to public figures who support abortion rights, including President Joe Biden, Francis urged them to make their decisions from a “pastoral” viewpoint and not a political one. The pope has said he has never denied communion to anyone. Francis has criticized couples who choose to have pets rather than children, aligning with views expressed by Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, a converted Catholic who has derided women without kids as “childless cat ladies” and described those in the country’s “leadership class” who don’t have children as “more sociopathic.” US Catholics also have a range of views. According to Pew Research, 52% of Catholic registered voters describe themselves as being or leaning Republican, while 44% say they are or lean Democrat. Catholic voters were split in 2020, with 50% voting for Biden and 49% supporting Trump, according to Pew. But a majority of Catholics – 61% – believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

Slower inflation is boosting Americans’ attitudes toward the economy | CNN Business,"Updated 11:48 AM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T14:28:05.291Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/economy/consumer-sentiment-september-inflation/index.html,"Americans are feeling a greater sense of optimism about the US economy this month, thanks to slower inflation. Voters also see a greater likelihood that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming November election. The University of Michigan’s latest consumer survey, released Friday, showed that Americans’ attitudes toward the economy improved notably this month, rising 2% from August, according to a preliminary reading. That broke a monthslong spell of consumer sentiment mostly holding steady, aside from a modest increase last month. Sentiment is now 40% higher than the record low reached in June 2022, when inflation was running red hot, but it still remains below pre-pandemic levels. “Consumer sentiment rose to its highest reading since May 2024, increasing for the second consecutive month and lifting about 2% above August,” Joanne Hsu, director of the university’s Surveys of Consumers, said in a release. “The gain was led by an improvement in buying conditions for durables, driven by more favorable prices as perceived by consumers.” The survey also noted that “a growing share of both Republicans and Democrats now anticipate a Harris win,” a few days after Harris and Trump went toe-to-toe during their first presidential debate, hosted on Tuesday by ABC. US consumers also felt more upbeat about inflation’s future. Expectations for inflation rates in the year head declined for the fourth-straight month in September, according to the report, reaching its lowest reading since December 2020. The US economy clearly looms large this election season, from the country’s housing affordability crisis to the state of inflation — and it was the first topic discussed during this week’s Harris-Trump debate. How the economy evolves between now and early November, when voters head to polls, could continue to shape voters’ perceptions. Inflation is down substantially from the 40-year highs of summer 2022, and after a rough patch earlier this year, it’s perched at an annual rate of 2.5% as of August, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which the Federal Reserve uses for its official 2% inflation target, has similarly shown easing price pressure over the past two years. Price increases across the board have come down markedly compared to two years ago, especially for gasoline — which plays a prominent role in influencing consumers’ perception of prices. “If consumers are focused on the cumulative increase of prices over the last four years, that favors Trump. But as we’re looking at the progress toward getting inflation back down to 2%, the Fed’s target, that’s tilting voters’ perceptions in favor of Harris,” Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN in an interview. Trump and Harris have both laid out proposals for an electorate worn out by years of high inflation and elevated interest rates."

Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump on Friday promoted a baseless claim circulating on right-wing social media that Kamala Harris wore an earpiece at Tuesday’s ABC presidential debate and again baselessly suggested that the vice president received the debate questions in advance.  The conspiracy theory about the earpiece has been promoted by far-right agitator Laura Loomer, who has traveled with Trump in recent days. “Interesting choice of earrings tonight, @KamalaHarris…” Loomer posted Wednesday on social media, including a screenshot of an article about “audio earrings.” As CNN previously reported, several people close to Trump say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories the former president has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the ABC debate was “rigged,” and he has previously baselessly suggested that Harris was provided the questions in advance. The former president said this week that he won’t participate in another debate, while Harris has called for another face-off. Trump suggested Friday, though, that he may change his mind about another debate. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said Friday that former President Donald Trump should debate Kamala Harris for a second time and consider changing his approach in order to reach swing voters. “Look, anytime you can spend more time in front of the voters when you’re in a close race, it’s a positive,” the Republican governor told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.” Sununu, who has been critical of Trump in the past and is retiring at the end of his fourth two-year term next year, added that the former president “knows what he wants to say” but he should adapt his style to debating Harris. “So there’s an opportunity there, but they have to use the opportunity the right way and really re-establish a connection with those voters that they had in 2016,” he said. Take a look at the positions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country that has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began last October. Harris: After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed Joe Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, as well as the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.” However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” and said, “I will not be silent.” The vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August. Harris said that as president, she would maintain the US alliance with Israel and “ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.”  Trump: The former president also met with Netanyahu in July, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict. In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.” Many Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must “finish what they started,” “get it over with fast,” and that the US must “let Israel finish the job.” Read more about the candidates and where they stand on key issues. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday continued to draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump as she seized on post-debate momentum in Pennsylvania.  Harris again slammed his debate performance, calling it a “tired playbook,” while claiming he failed to address the needs of Americans. “Well, folks, it’s time to turn the page. Let’s turn the page… And we are not going back, because America is ready for a new way forward,” she said. The vice president stressed the importance of small businesses and she repeatedly hit her opponent on his economic agenda, including attacking Trump for suggesting he only has “concepts of a plan” to end the Affordable Care Act, but not laying out how he would replace it. While touting her economic own plan, Harris also focused part of her message on job opportunities that don’t require 4-year degrees. Harris’ visited Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre on Friday, both in counties that Trump won in 2016 and 2020. Vice President Kamala Harris told a local Pennsylvania station Friday she thinks she can win over voters who may align with former President Donald Trump’s values but are tired of divisiveness. Pressed on how she differs from President Joe Biden, who recently campaigned with Harris in Pennsylvania, Harris responded, “I’m obviously not Joe Biden, and you know, I offer a new generation of leadership,” saying she recognizes in her economic approach “some of the stuff we could take for granted years ago, we can’t take for granted anymore.”  She said people are “exhausted” by Trump’s approach and want a leader who has “common sense and tries to find common ground,” pointing to her recent endorsements by Republicans including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former congresswoman Liz Cheney. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to increase her travel to more rural counties that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 in the coming weeks, as the campaign tries to pick up voters and drive down support for her Republican rival, according to two sources familiar.   The vice president’s stops in Pennsylvania today are the latest reflection of the campaign’s hopes to make inroads with voters who may not be die-hard Democrats but are uninterested in former President Donald Trump.  On Friday, Harris returned to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Trump won by double digits in 2020.  That also includes building out infrastructure and field offices in those counties. The Harris campaign recently opened its 50th campaign office in Pennsylvania.  Late last month, Harris similarly did a swing through south Georgia, a region that typically leans Republican, in another attempt to curtail Trump’s advantage in rural areas. The strategy is also a play to reach Nikki Haley voters, sources say, including in areas like Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Gov. Tim Walz campaigned in Lancaster County last week.  CNN previously reported that many conversations at Harris campaign headquarters focus on the 5-6% of voters who are still showing up undecided in battleground states, the set opinions those voters have of Trump and the continuing interest they tend to say they have in learning more about Harris. Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record during her campaign and outlined her policies. Trump’s attacks stem from President Joe Biden having tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security. Here’s a look at what both candidates have proposed on the issue: Trump Harris Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s stances on key issues. The Nevada Green Party on Friday asked the US Supreme Court to weigh into an election dispute with potentially significant implications in the presidential battleground, asking the high court to pause a state court ruling that would keep candidate Jill Stein off the ballot. Green Party candidates were “ripped from the ballot,” according to the emergency appeal and “Nevadans who would vote for them in this election are robbed of the opportunity to do so.” The Green Party is being represented by Jay Sekulow, one of former President Donald Trump’s personal attorneys. The emergency appeal follows a decision from Nevada’s high court last week that found the Green Party used an incorrect form when collecting signatures to get their candidates’ names on the ballot. The original lawsuit against the Green Party was filed by the state Democratic Party. The wrangling underscores the significance of third-party candidates on the ballot in a state where polling indicates a thin margin between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Nevada’s State Democratic Party sued the state’s Green Party to keep Stein off the ballot, arguing that the Green Party had used the wrong form to collect and submit the signatures needed to get this candidate on the ballot. Read more details here about the dispute in Nevada Just hours after Donald Trump claimed Friday he wasn’t aware of Laura Loomer’s controversial past statements, the former president wrote on Truth Social that he disagreed with her.  Trump did not specify in the post which past statements by Loomer he disagrees with. Loomer, a far-right provocateur, has for years pushed baseless conspiracy theories, including a post last year that claimed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US were an “inside job.” She has a long track record of racist and Islamophobic social media posts that have at times resulted in her losing access to her social media accounts.  Just hours before joining Trump on a flight to the Philadelphia debate on Tuesday, Loomer posted a racist comment about Vice President Kamala Harris’ Indian heritage. She also previously pushed a baseless attack accusing Harris of hiding her Black identity, which Trump later echoed in remarks he made at an event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to use her remarks in Pennsylvania tonight to speak directly to voters who might gravitate to former President Donald Trump, focusing her message on job opportunities that don’t require four-year degrees, according to a campaign adviser.  On Friday, Harris returned to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Trump won by double digits in 2020.  Earlier Friday, she told reporters she felt good about Pennsylvania, a crucial state for her campaign. With Friday’s visits to Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Harris will have spent all or part of seven of the past eight days in Pennsylvania.   Right-wing media outlets are ignoring Donald Trump’s embrace of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, shielding their audience from the uproar amid condemnation from top Republicans. In recent days, Donald Trump has mingled with Loomer, the radical conspiracy theorist who has a well-documented history of pushing racist, sexist, Islamophobic and homophobic hate. Loomer has been banned from most social media platforms for her vile rhetoric, though her account was restored in 2022 on X after Elon Musk, himself an avid Trump supporter, purchased the platform. Loomer’s presence with Trump at this week’s presidential debate and 9/11 memorial ceremonies has drawn widespread attention from mainstream news outlets, with major publications and television outlets spotlighting her appearance with the former president. The move has also ignited public condemnation and disgust even among those in his own party. But right-wing media outlets have largely ignored her close proximity to Trump and the ensuing controversy. On Fox News, the network has mentioned Loomer’s presence just once since she was first seen deboarding Trump’s private plane on Tuesday at the Philadelphia debate, according to TVEyes database searches. A check of the right-wing network’s website also showed zero mentions of Loomer this week. That was also the case in other right-wing outlets, including the websites of Breitbart, Newsmax, The Daily Wire, One America News, and The Gateway Pundit. Read more here about the right-wing media’s coverage The North Carolina State Board of Elections announced a revised schedule for sending out mail-in ballots after a legal battle with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy delayed the process.   Ballots will begin going out in two separate batches on September 20 and September 24, according to the NCSBE. The original deadline to get ballots out was September 6, as state law requires absentee ballots to begin shipping 60 days before the general election. All 100 county boards must send ballots to military and overseas voters who requested them on September 20, allowing the state to avoid missing the September 21 federal deadline to begin sending these ballots.  Absentee by mail ballots for all other North Carolina voters who have requested them will start going out on September 24, more than two weeks after state law requires.  North Carolina was supposed to kick off voting in the 2024 general election last Friday, but a ruling from the state Court of Appeals on a motion from Kennedy to have his name removed from the ballot put that on hold.  This week, the state Supreme Court ordered that new ballots must be reprinted without Kennedy and his We The People party on them.  Each county is responsible for covering the costs to recode, reprocess and reprint the ballots. The NCSBE said that, through Thursday, “more than 166,000 voters – including more than 13,600 military and overseas voters – have requested ballots in North Carolina.” Due to the federal deadline, preparing and sending military and overseas ballots was made a priority and the board determined the only way to do this was to have two different dates for sending them. Abortion and reproductive rights are a key issue in the 2024 campaign. Here’s a look at where each candidate stands on the topic. Kamala Harris’ stance: Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the Biden administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. This past January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic. On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions. Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger. The issue was a key part of the programming at the Democratic National Convention this summer and Harris’ campaign announced the launch of a 50-stop bus tour last month — starting in Trump’s backyard of Palm Beach, Florida — focused on reproductive health care. Donald Trump’s stance: Trump last month said he will not support a ballot referendum to expand abortion access in his home state of Florida just 24 hours after suggesting he might. The rush to clarify his stance followed intense blowback from anti-abortion advocates online, leading to concerns among Republicans that Trump’s continued waffling on abortion might lose him some deeply religious voters in a tightening race. Trump, whose ever-evolving views on reproductive health have traversed every side of the debate, has long expressed concerns about the political fallout from the 2022 Supreme Court decision to end the constitutional right to an abortion. Though he has sought credit for installing the three conservative justices that tipped the court to overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump earlier this year said future questions about access should be left to the states. Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban and has taken the position that abortion laws should be decided by states. He’s also said that he supports exceptions in cases of rape and incest and when the life of the mother is under threat. Trump said in May that he did not support banning birth control. He previously said that he was “looking at” contraceptives when asked if he supported restrictions. In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for. Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Former President Donald Trump suggested Friday that his mind might change about a second debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.  On Thursday, Trump shut down the idea of a second debate with Harris, announcing on Truth Social that “THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!” Reporters asked Trump what he would need or want in order to participate in another debate. “I wouldn’t need anything. I could do it tomorrow, but I’ve done two debates,” Trump said, referring to his first debate with President Joe Biden in June.   Earlier in his remarks, Trump dismissed a reporter’s question about Republicans who’ve said that he missed the mark in the debate with Harris.  “Most of my Republican allies had said I was great in the debate,” Trump said. Senate GOP Whip John Thune on Friday said Republicans would consider campaign trail proposals made by former President Donald Trump when working to advance tax policy if they regain the Senate majority, and made clear that renewing Trump’s 2017 tax cuts were the top priority. Asked on a press call with Wisconsin Republican Senate candidate Eric Hovde how the GOP could advance Trump’s most recent proposal to eliminate taxes on overtime pay, Thune said it would be helpful “obviously, if we can get a majority, and Eric is certainly key to that,” touting the entrepreneur’s experience with managing payroll and workers. Trump said in Arizona on Thursday that he would back legislation to get rid of taxes on overtime if he’s reelected. He previously has said he would also work to eliminate taxes on tips, another policy aimed at appealing to working Americans.  “There have been a lot of proposals that have been made throughout the course of the campaign,” Thune acknowledged, adding that extending the 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of 2025 is an issue the Senate will have to deal with immediately. Vice President Kamala Harris said she’s feeling “very good” about the state of the race in battleground Pennsylvania during a campaign stop here on Friday. Harris vowed to spend significant time in the state ahead of the election, focusing on mobilizing voters. Harris stopped by the store, called Classic Elements, alongside the state’s Democratic Sen. John Fetterman. She spoke to the owners of the shop before addressing a small crowd. The vice president said small businesses are a way to “lift people up,” and credited the owners for creating a safe community gathering place at a time when there are forces “trying to kind of make people feel alone or divide us.” More on the Pennsylvania swing: Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre — where Harris will hold a rally later today — are in two counties that former President Donald Trump won in 2016 and 2020. Harris has spent seven of the last eight days in the Keystone State, punctuating her campaign’s emphasis on the battleground. Former President Donald Trump promised “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio, a town that has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including his running mate Sen. JD Vance, have spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets.  According to the city of Springfield’s website, the total immigrant population is estimated at about 12,000 to 15,000 in Clark County, though it does not designate from which countries. The frequently asked questions section on its website notes that Haitian immigrants are there legally under the Immigration Parole Program. Trump claimed “nests of bad people” are being emptied into the United States, calling it “an invasion from within.”  Throughout his campaign, Trump has vowed to have the biggest mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.  “It’s going to get worse at a level like nobody’s ever seen before,” Trump said, speaking more generally about immigration and the border. Former President Donald Trump on Friday escalated his criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2021 Kabul airport attack during the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. Trump said during a news conference in Los Angeles that the 13 US military service members were killed “as though Kamala shot them with a pistol in her hand, or his hand; they were killed by (President Joe) Biden and Kamala.” Trump made the comments as he spoke about his recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery, in which he participated in a wreath-laying ceremony with family members of those who were killed during the Kabul attack and visited a location where some of the US service members are buried. The former president was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. The Army has said participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity, and an employee of the cemetery who “attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside.” For context: Trump frequently criticizes Harris and Biden for the Afghanistan withdrawal on the campaign trail. It was a central line of attack on Biden when he was running for reelection, and now that Harris is the Democratic nominee, Trump has shifted to seeking to place blame directly on her for the chaotic withdrawal and the attack. Former President Donald Trump said he doesn’t control far-right agitator Laura Loomer, whom he described as a supporter and a “free spirit.” Trump was responding to a question from CNN about his allies expressing concern about his close relationship with the provocateur in recent days. Loomer has been on a handful of trips with Trump and appears often at events where he is speaking, and there have been times her bombastic social media posts have appeared to preview Trump’s next line of attack. Pressed about his allies’ concern, Trump said, “Look, I can’t tell Laura what to do.”   In response to questions about her racist and conspiratorial comments, Trump said he’d just heard about it for the first time. Two days before the debate, Loomer said that if Vice President Kamala Harris, who is half Indian, wins the election, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Trump ally and conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene condemned the remark, calling it “appalling and extremely racist.” Former President Donald Trump on Friday said the “real threat is what’s happening at our border” when asked about bomb threats in Springfield, Ohio, and schools being evacuated as Trump and his Republican allies spread a debunked conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants in the area eating pets.  A reporter at a news conference in Los Angeles started asking Trump about the false claims, and the former president said, “No, no. The real threat is what’s happening at our border.” Trump said earlier in the news conference that “maybe” he would hold a campaign event in Springfield.  “We could, and maybe we’ll do that,” Trump said. Trump repeated the debunked conspiracy theory during the presidential debate earlier this week and at his campaign event in Arizona on Thursday. Pope Francis on Friday described the choice US voters must make in the presidential election as one between the “lesser of two evils,” deeming former President Donald Trump’s anti-migrant policies and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights as both being “against life.” The pontiff was asked what his advice to Catholic voters would be when choosing between the candidates.  The head of the Roman Catholic church said that deporting migrants is “evil” and that not giving migrants work and not helping them is “a sin against life.” Meanwhile, Francis described abortion as an “assassination.”  “Whether you like the word or not, it is killing,” he added. President Joe Biden celebrated the contributions of Black Americans and offered criticism of former President Donald Trump’s disparagement of Haitian migrants during a Black Excellence brunch hosted at the White House Friday.  Biden condemned the false claim promoted by Trump at this week’s presidential debate that Haitian migrants are stealing and eating other people’s pets. Other high-level Republicans, including vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, have propagated the lie.  Biden touted his efforts to place racial equity “at the center of everything we do,” and made a joke about Black jobs, a jab at Trump.  “We created over 2 million new Black jobs for Black Americans,” he said to laughter, adding, “By the way, the next Black job to be filled is as president of the United States.” Vice President Kamala Harris, who was originally set to attend the brunch, was not present, with her office citing “scheduling conflicts.” Biden said she “wanted to be here.” Biden offered praise of the leadership of Black Americans at the conclusion of Congressional Black Caucus Week, highlighting the community’s support for his political career as it reaches its close: “The Black community has always had my back and I’ve always had yours.” The crowd chanted, “Thank you, Joe” in response.   “This nation would not exist – this is literal – without the blood, sweat, and tears, without the determinations, dreams, and contributions of Black Americans,” Biden said in front of the White House, a building built by enslaved people.  Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump, and their respective allies are unleashing a flood of new campaign ads heading into the weekend as the candidates fan out to battleground states and they press their message on the airwaves. Harris ads: On Friday, Harris’ campaign went up with a series of TV ads focused on the economy and tailored to the critical battlegrounds, containing the same narration and messaging, but with images of different cities and local landmarks. The ad features Harris making her economic pitch. Her appearance in it reflects a concerted effort by the campaign to put the candidate in front of the camera, often narrating. The ads began airing in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia — and one is even tailored to Nebraska, where Democrats are hoping to secure one of the states’ up-for-grabs electoral votes. The ads come as Harris is set to hold several campaign events in Pennsylvania today. The Harris campaign is also up with its first ad featuring clips from Tuesday’s debate, highlighting the moment that Trump was pressed on his abortion policy. Trump ads: Countering those efforts, the Trump campaign and its allies have also launched a series of new ads heading into the weekend, leaning into an anti-Harris messaging campaign that has been increasingly focused on the economy. On Friday, the Trump campaign launched its latest ad slamming Harris and the Biden administration for inflation. It follows a new ad in Pennsylvania that the Trump campaign launched on Thursday about fracking. The pair of new ads from the Trump campaign, both focused on key economic issues, reflect an evolving messaging approach. While Trump and his allies have consistently criticized all aspects of the Biden-Harris administration record, the emphasis lately has been on the economy as opposed to immigration and crime.  At Kamala Harris’ campaign headquarters, aides are already working toward more appearances like the vice president’s online conversation next week with Oprah Winfrey, instead of any big speeches or more policy rollouts like her economic plans, unless the campaign sees ways to leverage those into grabbing more attention. Yet Harris advisers are running into limits of the calendar: Unless they succeed in goading Trump into accepting a second debate, the only big event left before Election Day is the Tim Walz-JD Vance vice presidential debate on October 1. David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama’s campaign manager, is leading the push among Harris advisers for breakthrough moments and innovative appearances. Harris and many around her tend to be dismissive of the value of traditional media, and believe they get more of a boost from putting her in situations like hugging voters during a brief Sunday stop at a spice store in Pittsburgh than she ever would from any interview. Plouffe’s role is in part affected by the simmering tension between different factions —carryover Biden aides, new staff who came with Harris, a clutch of Obama alumni who parachuted in together, and the core group of advisers who tend to spend the most time with the candidate on the road and at the Naval Observatory — although the infighting looks nothing like the dysfunction of Harris’ 2019 bid. Campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon’s leadership retreat last week, for example, was part therapy for aides coming off their rollercoaster summer. But it was also part information sharing — amid the massive divergence in political conditions, ballot propositions and candidates that Harris aides believe could upend the trend of recent elections where states move in regional blocs. Translating the summer enthusiasm into fall work without the enthusiasm draining won’t be easy, said Dan Kildee, a retiring Democratic congressman from the critical battleground of Michigan. He said he’s heartened that 35,000 new volunteers signed up in his state since Harris became the nominee, but he said that won’t matter unless they’re managed and deployed correctly. Obama is expected to be central in that effort, with aides working to add to his usual slate of late fall battleground campaign rallies — in person or with online influencers, whom he’s been pushing to use their platforms to get followers to vote.

In CNN polling released earlier this month of six swing states, economic issues remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters in their choice for president. Below is a snapshot of what the candidates have proposed so far: Highlights of Kamala Harris’ economic promises Highlights of Donald Trump’s economic promises Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Americans are feeling a greater sense of optimism about the US economy this month, thanks to slower inflation. And voters also see a greater likelihood that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming November election, according to the latest consumer survey from the University of Michigan. The survey, released Friday, showed that Americans’ attitudes toward the economy rose 2% from August. Sentiment is now 40% higher than the record low reached in June 2022, when inflation was running red hot, but it still remains below pre-pandemic levels. The survey also noted that “a growing share of both Republicans and Democrats now anticipate a Harris win,” a few days after Tuesday’s presidential debate. US consumers also felt more upbeat about inflation’s future: Expectations for inflation rates in the year ahead reached the lowest reading since December 2020. Rose Goute Creole restaurant does a bustling business in Springfield, Ohio, with clientele drawn to its pots of perfumed rice, fried pork and fish, and golden plantains. Rosena Jean Louis runs the front, offering free coffee and patiently managing a jostling lunch crowd. She and her coworkers are proud of the food they serve, feeding a Haitian expatriate community that has grown quickly in Springfield over the past few years. When asked about a lie that has taken hold in some corners of the internet that their countrymen are stealing and eating people’s pets, she rolls her eyes in exasperation. When CNN visited on Wednesday, the restaurant’s manager, Romane Pierre, recalled his incredulity at the claim that has been promoted by prominent national-level Republicans, including Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Local officials have repeatedly tried to stop the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” The state’s highest Republican official, Gov. Mike DeWine, also dismissed the rumor, noting there was “no evidence of that at all.” And Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday the false claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance, a Republican from Ohio. Read the full story. The great showman just turned his back on tens of millions of viewers. Donald Trump’s refusal to take part in another presidential debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris marks a significant moment in the 2024 campaign — and hints at vulnerability for a political career built on the foundation of his television fame and mastery of stagecraft. The ex-president said he doesn’t need a rematch because he won the debate, despite overwhelming reviews saying he bombed against a vice president who outdid a former reality star. But there’s an alternative possible explanation: that Trump — who usually can’t resist a chance to dominate the small screen — doesn’t relish a repeat of a showdown in which he was unprepared and unfocused and squandered his best chance to take down his opponent in a cliffhanger election. He might be right to mitigate the risk: polls show he’s in a dead heat with Harris in a race where the fundamentals on top voter priorities like the economy and immigration may favor him. Harris said she and her opponent owed it to voters to debate again. Trump’s move opened the way for her team to boast that he is scared to debate her and to boost a performance in which she mocked and rebuked an ill-tempered ex-president with a swagger and a smile. The Republican nominee often changes his mind. But his announcement that there wouldn’t be another debate seemed more adamant than many of his previous statements. Read the full analysis. Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris could have a significant impact on key battleground states, new numbers from the nonprofit, nonpartisan voting organization Vote.org shared with CNN suggests.  Since Swift’s post encouraging her supporters to get registered, 52,222 Americans have registered to vote via Vote.org, and 144,243 people have verified their registration status.  That has included thousands of registrations in swing states where both the Harris and Trump campaigns are expecting razor-thin margins.  From 11:00 pm ET on Tuesday to 1:00 pm ET Thursday:  The Democratic Party is also seeking to harness Swift’s political potency, launching Swift-inspired digital billboards featuring images of Harris. One of the billboards is 22-stories atop the iconic red steps in New York’s Times Square. The other is in Las Vegas. This comes as the Harris campaign sold out of Swift-inspired friendship bracelets, and former President Donald Trump’s campaign has also sought to get in on the action, selling Eras Tour-inspired t-shirts with Trump’s likeness. A super PAC with Republican ties is running digital ads in Michigan promoting the Jewish faith of Kamala Harris’ husband and touting Harris’ support for Israel — an apparently cynical play to undercut Harris with the battleground state’s large Arab American population amid ongoing political fallout over the war in Gaza. The super PAC, Future Coalition PAC, has spent nearly $60,000 running several YouTube ads targeting exclusively Michigan, according to Google’s Ads Transparency Center. Each of the ads emphatically states Harris’ support for Israel, and many pointedly highlight her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish. The New York Times first reported on the ads. One of the ads from the group hones in on the role of Harris’ husband Emhoff, including images of Emhoff wearing a yamaka, and of the second gentleman visiting the Auschwitz concentration camp. “Kamala Harris is a strong leader for these difficult times. And joining Kamala will be her husband and top adviser, Doug Emhoff. Doug Emhoff, who would be the first Jewish presidential spouse ever. Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff: making history, standing up for what’s right, supporting Israel.” Another one of the ads opens, “Vice President Harris has chosen a side, the right side. Harris has made herself clear: she stands with Israel and the Jewish people. She has, again and again. She understands the unbreakable bond between the US and Israel.” The ads — which are framed positively and accompanied by stirring music — would appear to be in support of Harris’ presidential bid – but the group behind them and their precise targeting in battleground Michigan suggest a more cynical motive. Formed earlier this month, Future Coalition PAC has not yet filed a report detailing its donors or fundraising with the Federal Election Commission. Other filings from the group, however, include GOP links; the group lists as its assistant treasurer Cabell Hobbs, who served as the treasurer for a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 2024 presidential bid. In addition, the ads are exclusively running in Michigan, one of seven top battleground states that are poised to decide the 2024 election, and which is home to a large Arab American population. The ads appear aimed at stoking divisions spilling from the ongoing war in Gaza, and undercutting Harris’ efforts to patch up the fraying Democratic coalition that includes those voters there. If anyone was in doubt about Kamala Harris’s electoral strategy, a glimpse of her calendar gives you a clue. With Friday’s visits to Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Harris will have spent all or part of 7 of the past 8 days in Pennsylvania. Yesterday, when she traveled to North Carolina, was the only day in the past week she hasn’t set foot in the Keystone State. After traveling to Pittsburgh for a five-day debate camp, she went to Philadelphia for the debate itself and returned a day later to Shanksville for a 9/11 commemoration. She’ll return Friday to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Donald Trump won in 2020, hoping to convert voters as she enters a grind-it-out phase of her campaign. It’s all an indication that even as Harris looks to open up multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes, Pennsylvania remains a linchpin of her strategy.  Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said that the false claims being promoted by Donald Trump’s campaign that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community.” Asked what he would say to the former president, Rue said: “we need help, not hate.”  Rue also stated that it is “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Trump’s running mate JD Vance, who is a Republican senator in the state. City Hall in Springfield was forced to close on Thursday due to a bomb threat issued to multiple facilities. Rue told CNN that there are currently no leads into who was behind the threat that was sent via email.  Rue also revealed that city officials, including himself, have received hateful phone calls and emails.  At a leadership retreat for top aides last week, Jen O’Malley Dillon – the campaign chair hired by Joe Biden and retained by Kamala Harris – ticked through the battleground states and warned them: the vice president still did not have any one sure path to 270 electoral votes. Pennsylvania looks rough, though very possible, by their internal numbers before the debate. North Carolina, disappointing Democrats every election for the last 15 years, is feeling better to them this time than Arizona, which Biden narrowly won four years ago. Nevada and Georgia seem possible, though depending on the poll, can take a lot of squinting. Michigan and Wisconsin are looking like the best of the bunch for Harris, according to the campaign’s internal numbers. That makes for a lot of potential paths to victory based on the current and projected internal data, O’Malley Dillon told them, but multiple top aides on the Harris campaign told CNN they fear that if the election were held next Tuesday instead of eight Tuesdays from now, Trump still would be in a good position to win. Leading Democrats are stressing out that Harris could be in danger of losing the excitement and good vibes they need to overpower what they expect to be high and devoted turnout for Trump. But that is not the feeling in Harris’ campaign headquarters, where many conversations focus on the 5-6% of voters still showing up undecided in battleground states, the set opinions those voters have of Trump, and the continuing interest they tend to say they have in learning more about Harris. Read the full story. Most likely voters in six key battleground states express at least some confidence in their state’s election process, according to recent CNN polling conducted by SSRS. But far fewer of them have high confidence in the process, with that mistrust driven largely by voters who support former President Donald Trump. Overall, two-thirds or more of likely voters in each of the six states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – say they’re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be cast and counted accurately, ranging from 68% in Arizona to 79% in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is the only state where a majority – 52% – say they’re very confident about the accuracy of their state’s voting process, with 46% in Michigan and only about 4 in 10 in the remaining states expressing similarly high confidence. But the results in each state also show a wide and continuing political gulf on faith in the electoral system, echoing Trump’s repeated efforts to undermine confidence in it. At Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump again refused to acknowledge his election loss in 2020 – a stance that follows social media posts made last week in which he threatened to prosecute election officials if he retakes the presidency and raised baseless attacks on the validity of mail-in voting in Pennsylvania. While 71% of Harris supporters in the six states are, on average, very confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted, an average of just 15% of Trump supporters across these states feel the same way. And sizable shares of Trump voters lack even modest confidence in the system. Read more about this polling. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to travel to Pennsylvania as she seeks to capitalize on post-debate momentum in key battleground states, according to her campaign. Harris will visit Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre — located in two counties that former President Donald Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. The campaign believes the vice president must take her message directly to swing voters in counties where she seeks to grow her support. In Johnstown, Harris is expected to visit a local small business alongside Sen. John Fetterman as she highlights her “opportunity economy” agenda, which includes a handful of new benefits to entrepreneurs and small business owners to spur the creation of millions of new businesses.  She will then travel to Wilkes-Barre and deliver remarks at a campaign rally. The vice president will be introduced by Mary-Grace Vadalla, a local Republican nurse who lost her mom to COVID-19 and is married to a public school teacher. Additional speakers include Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Bob Casey. Harris’ team has developed a plan for the coming days and weeks to place her in front of battleground state voters, which began Thursday with two stops in Charlotte and Greensboro, North Carolina. In both the Keystone and Tar Heel states, early voting is already about to get underway, and a campaign official tells CNN it’s no coincidence that this is where Harris is hitting the trail this week. The campaign will deploy some of its top surrogates today. Gov. Walz will make tour stops in Grand Rapids, Lansing, Michigan and Wausau, Wisconsin. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff will stop in The Villages, Florida, and Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz will be in Bangor and Portland, Maine. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are back on the campaign trail today as they make their pitch to voters with less than two months until Election Day. Harris will be making campaign stops in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Trump is will holding a press availability in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and holding a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, tonight; Harris’ running mate Tim Walz will participate in political events in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and in Wausau, Wisconsin. Donald Trump said he would not participate in another presidential debate with Kamala Harris. At a rally in Charlotte, Harris said: “I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important.” Here are other headlines you should know: After the debate: The Taylor Swift effect: New ads launched: Trump campaign proposals: Trump legal woes: Former Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary Clinton praised Vice President Kamala Harris in the epilogue for her upcoming book, “Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, and Liberty,” calling Harris’ historic run “exciting” and “exhilarating.” Clinton said Democrats “will miss Joe Biden’s steady leadership, deep empathy and fighting spirit. He is a wise and decent man who served our country well, yet we have gained much too—a new champion, an invigorated campaign and a renewed sense of purpose.”  In the audio recording of the epilogue, Clinton details her first reactions after she got off the phone with Harris, saying she looked at former President Bill Clinton “with a huge smile and said, this is exciting.” Clinton, who ran against Trump but lost in 2016, said she imagined Harris taking the oath of office as the first woman president, saying “it will prove that our best days are still ahead and that we are making progress on our long journey toward a more perfect union.”  MSNBC first reported on the audio of Clinton’s reaction to Harris becoming the nominee. As Donald Trump posed for pictures with firefighters in New York City to observe the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attack, a small entourage of the former president’s inner circle looked on. The group included the two most powerful individuals in Trump’s orbit, his co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. Standing near them was another figure whose sway with the Republican nominee also cannot be discounted: the far-right provocateur Laura Loomer. Last year, Loomer posted a video on social media claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an “inside job,” an illogical but pervasive conspiracy theory. Asked why Loomer joined Trump for his Patriot Day travels in New York and then Pennsylvania, a campaign official declined to address her presence directly. Loomer, in a phone interview with CNN, said: The former president has long embraced conspiracy theories and has regularly aligned himself with those who peddle them, especially if they support him.  Read the full story. Pete Buttigieg on Thursday slammed former President Donald Trump’s recent false claims that migrants are eating pets, saying it’s a strategy to distract from the Republican presidential nominee’s record. In recent days, Trump and his allies, including running mate JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Trump repeated the conspiracy theory during the ABC presidential debate Tuesday night, although the City of Springfield and the local police have said they’ve seen no evidence for the claim. Buttigieg, who spoke in his personal capacity but serves as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, said that while he thinks it is a distraction technique, “it contributes to this bigger picture of demonizing immigrants.” Buttigieg praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance but stressed that groundwork and organizing is more important to win the race. Election Day is less than two months away, and both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have a busy schedule of campaign events today following their presidential debate. Trump said he would not participate in a third debate, while the vice president’s campaign called for another one following Tuesday night’s event on ABC. Here’s more on the campaign:"

A 61% majority of Trump supporters in Georgia and 58% of Trump supporters in Wisconsin say they’re at least somewhat confident that their states’ votes will be accurately handled, but that falls to 50% in Nevada and lower in Pennsylvania (47%), Arizona (46%) and Michigan (44%). In Georgia, where the Republican-controlled state election board recently approved new rules that critics say form a framework that could be used to contest the election results, the gap between backers of Harris and Trump in confidence is significantly smaller. Harris supporters here in the Peach State are less likely than those in other states to express at least some confidence in the system – 82% do so, compared with 92% or more in each of the other five states. That’s only about 20 points above the level of confidence among Trump’s backers in Georgia, compared with gaps between 40 and 50 points in each of the other five states. The findings are similar to the overall picture two years ago, when between 40% and 48% of likely midterm voters in five of the same states said they were very confident in election accuracy. (The same question was not asked in Georgia that year.) The results echo other recent polling on attitudes toward the country’s election system, including a national ABC News/Ipsos poll released just before Labor Day weekend that found a 92% majority of Harris-supporting adults saying that they were prepared to accept the election outcome, falling to 76% among Trump-supporting adults. In a July CNN poll, 71% of Americans said they doubted Trump would concede if he loses this year, up from the 58% who said the same in October 2020, ahead of that year’s presidential election. The same poll also found that 85% of registered voters and 77% of voters who support Trump said the loser of the presidential election had an obligation to accept the results and concede. Harris supporters’ expressions of confidence in the election process come amid a campaign that many of her backers view as a referendum on democracy itself. In each of the six states, Harris supporters choose “protecting democracy” as the most important issue in this year’s election, with an average of 43% in each state calling it their top voting issue. By contrast, only 9% of Trump supporters, on average, say the same. Interviews for the CNN polls were conducted August 23-29, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 682 voters in Arizona, 617 in Georgia, 708 in Michigan, 626 in Nevada, 789 in Pennsylvania and 976 in Wisconsin. Results for likely voters, which include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election, have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 points in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania; plus or minus 4.9 points in Michigan and Nevada; and plus or minus 4.4 points in Wisconsin.

Analysis: Why Trump ditched a debate rematch – for now | CNN Politics,"Updated 1:25 AM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T04:00:19.404Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/trump-no-debate-rematch-analysis/index.html,"The great showman just turned his back on tens of millions of viewers. At least for now. Donald Trump’s refusal to take part in another presidential debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris marks a significant moment in the 2024 campaign — and hints at vulnerability for a political career built on the foundation of his television fame and mastery of stagecraft. The ex-president said he doesn’t need a rematch because he won Tuesday night’s debate, despite overwhelming reviews saying he bombed against a vice president who outdid a former reality star. “Because we’ve done two debates and because they were successful, there will be no third debate. It’s too late anyway, the voting’s already begun,” Trump said during a wild campaign speech in Arizona on Thursday, also referring to his first debate against Joe Biden, on CNN in June, that led to the president being pushed out of the race by his own party. But there’s an alternative possible explanation: that Trump — who normally can’t resist a chance to dominate the small screen — doesn’t relish a repeat of a showdown in which he was unprepared and unfocused and squandered his best chance to take down his opponent in a cliffhanger election. The former president might be right to mitigate the risk; after all, polls show he’s in a dead heat with Harris in a race in which the fundamentals on top voter priorities like the economy and immigration may favor him. After Tuesday’s onstage meeting, Harris had said that she and her opponent owed it to voters to debate again. Trump’s move opened the way for her team to gloat that he is scared to debate her and to boost a performance in which she mocked and rebuked an ill-tempered ex-president with a swagger and a smile. Harris’ senior campaign adviser, David Plouffe, blasted Trump on X as “chicken man.” The Republican nominee often changes his mind. But his announcement on there not being another debate seemed more adamant than many of his previous statements and spin. His event in Arizona — apparently meant to focus on economic policy, judging by a backdrop that read “No taxes on tips” and “Make Housing Affordable” — revealed Trump to be still fuming over Tuesday night. He devoted a long period at the start of his speech to a play-by-play of the debate, bitterly complaining about Harris’ answers and claiming that he was set up by ABC News. His litany of complaints, however, flew in the face of his claim he won. “People said that I was angry at the debate, angry, and yes, I am angry because he (Biden) allowed 21 million illegal aliens invading our communities,” Trump said, using unverified figures on undocumented migration. Trump’s turn against a second debate with Harris came as both candidates headed out on the most intense burst of tit-for-tat campaigning in days. But Trump was also embroiled in yet another controversy over the extreme company he often keeps, after traveling to a 9/11 commemoration with far-right polemicist Laura Loomer, who has touted conspiracy theories about the 2001 attacks. Even Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman whose conspiratorial mindset has endeared her to the “Make America Great Again” movement, rebuked Loomer for an “appalling and extremely racist” social media post that denigrated Harris’ Indian American heritage. The furor over whether there’ll be another debate and Loomer’s proximity to Trump are examples of the heated controversies that flare in the endgames of campaigns, which can often appear irrelevant to the final result. But with a tight race now stripped down to a daily grind for possibly as few as several hundred thousand voters in a few states, such firestorms reveal a great deal about the candidates and their campaigns. Trump’s extreme defensiveness and Harris’ exuberance on the stump in North Carolina on Thursday paint a picture of how each campaign thinks its candidate did at the debate. As she did after her euphoric convention in Chicago, the Democratic nominee pleaded with her supporters not to get complacent. “Understand that we are the underdog,” the vice president told a huge crowd in Charlotte. It’s still too early for a critical mass of polling that could trace the true impact of the debate on the race eight weeks before Election Day. And the result of debates is often not a good predictor of an election result. But the candidates’ itineraries Thursday showed that each side understands how close the election could be. Democrats haven’t won North Carolina since 2008, but the state could help pave an alternative road to the White House if Harris can’t win critical Pennsylvania. Trump’s journey to Arizona stressed that a state that once seemed to be turning red when Biden was still running is now competitive again with Harris as a nominee who has expanded the electoral map for Democrats. Both candidates need to win over moderate, suburban, swing voters in the battleground states. And they are taking vastly different approaches to doing so. Harris on Thursday vowed to unite the country and courted traditional Republicans who are disaffected with Trump. She touted her endorsements from former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, and added, “Democrats, Republicans and independents are supporting our campaign.” If Harris is trying to woo the suburbs, Trump is trying to scare them. He ruminated on a series of dark scenarios around the idea that America was being invaded by foreigners, escaped prisoners and criminals who were overwhelming small towns with “Harris migrant crime.” He repeated the conservative-spread false claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are stealing and eating pets. While he occasionally reverted to what appeared to be a prepared text that highlighted Americans’ economic struggles – he announced that he would propose ending taxes on overtime, for example – Trump displayed the exact same lack of focus that hampered him in his debate performance. And he again appeared keener to unroll his outlandish rhetoric and dark jokes than hitting the issues that could win him the election. At times, Trump careened into bizarre diversions. For instance, and not for the first time, he seemed fixated by the size of a large man in the auditorium. He asked, “Wasn’t ‘The Apprentice’ a great show, though?” and wistfully reminisced about the final night of his election campaign in 2016. He also relayed conversations with former first lady Melania Trump in which he called her “Darling” and she critiqued his jokes, his hair and his habit of mocking the way Biden walked down a flight of stairs. It’s becoming increasingly obvious that Trump is underperforming his own campaign. His hard-hitting ads and his vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, are making sharper economic arguments than he is. Still, Trump still leads Harris in most polls when voters are asked who they trust most to manage the economy and immigration. So while his rhetoric seems egregious to many liberals, his message clearly resonates among millions of Americans. The economic argument, buried deep in his tirade, about the performance of the Biden-Harris administration hinted at the reasons why the former president may still win the election. His behavior for most of his Arizona speech showed why he may not. The ex-president’s continued ill-discipline on Thursday suggests one reason why his campaign may not want their candidate to climb back on a debate stage – after 60 million people watched his first meeting with Harris. But Bryan Lanza, a senior Trump campaign advisor, insisted that this was a tactical decision. “It’s not a function of being scared, it’s a function of what are our priorities towards the end of the election,” he said on CNN’s “The Situation Room.” Lanza added: “We have better opportunities through one-on-one interviews — through our rallies, through going into these states and having this impact – than going into a debate that is going to stack the deck against President Trump.” But Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said Harris had intimidated the former president. “Donald Trump was weak, he honestly came across as a little desperate,” Pritzker told Wolf Blitzer. “Kamala Harris came across as strong and presidential. If he had another debate with her and it happened again, that would be it for his campaign – he would be done.” Pritzker was spinning the best case for Harris. But she might not perform as well in a second debate. And in 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was judged the winner of each of her debates with Trump – but it was he who took the oath of office the following January. Not everyone who knows Trump thinks that his decision is final. Alyssa Farah Griffin, a CNN commentator who used to serve as Trump’s White House communications director, foresaw a scenario in which the ex-president might have a change of heart if he is trailing closer to Election Day. “I would predict that he may change his tune on this,” Griffin said on “The Situation Room.” “If Kamala Harris sees a bump in the polls from her performance in the debate where most folks think she won, I could see a world where in a couple of weeks Donald Trump says, ‘I challenge her to a debate,’” Griffin said. “I could see him thinking, if things get a little bit tighter in the final eight-week stretch, he might need a big moment to remain competitive against her.”"
Buttigieg: Trump and Vance ‘demonizing immigrants’ to distract from their record | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:22 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-13T03:19:52.113Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/buttigieg-trump-migrant-claims-distraction-cnntv/index.html,"Pete Buttigieg on Thursday slammed former President Donald Trump’s recent false claims that migrants are eating pets, saying it’s a strategy to distract from the Republican presidential nominee’s record. “There’s even more to it than demonizing immigrants – although that’s obviously part of what he’s doing,” said Buttigieg, appearing on CNN’s “The Source” with Kaitlan Collins. “This is a strategy to get us talking about the latest crazy thing that he did, whatever urban legend he amplifies – right now it’s about people eating cats or geese or whatever – because he cannot afford for us to be talking about his record.” In recent days, Trump and his allies, including running mate JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Trump repeated the conspiracy theory during the ABC presidential debate Tuesday night, although the City of Springfield and the local police have said they’ve seen no evidence for the claim. Buttigieg, who spoke in his personal capacity but serves as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, said that while he thinks it is a distraction technique, “it’s one that isn’t harmless.” “It’s affecting this community, and it contributes to this bigger picture of demonizing immigrants. But again this is strategic,” he said. Buttigieg praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance but stressed that groundwork and organizing is more important to win the race. “No one night, no one event, no one appearance, no one debate is going to decide this,” Buttigieg told Collins. “We’re getting into the stage of the campaign where the thing that’s going to decide it the most is the groundwork, the organizing.” Asked whether Harris would benefit from a second debate following Trump’s announcement that he won’t participate in another, Buttigieg said a second showdown with Trump is not the only way for Harris to get voters familiar with her. “She’ll be the first to say there’s still an underdog dynamic here. She’s going to have to work to gain every inch of political ground here, but that’s exactly what she’s doing,” Buttigieg said, pointing to Harris’ recent campaign stops across the country. The Democrat also contrasted Harris and Trump on their platforms, highlighting Harris’ support of expanding child tax credit and paid parental leave, while criticizing Trump’s recent comments on child care as “gibberish.” “Everyday, she’s talking about the American people, about what she’s going to do to continue to create jobs, what she’s going to do to grow small businesses in this country, what she’s going to do to help with child care — something Donald Trump seems literally, almost physically incapable of talking about,” Buttigieg said. When Trump was asked at an economic forum last week about how he would make child care more affordable, he responded that his plan to hike tariffs would raise enough revenue, without explaining how that would help families. Buttigieg pointed to that response, saying: “Every time he gets a question about it, you get a strange ramble that raises the question of whether he’s ever actually considered child care policy seriously.” Meanwhile, he argued, Harris “wants to expand the child tax credit, wants to make sure we have paid parental leave in this country. So that’s going to continue and I think that’s how she’s going to win.”"
Trump says he would push to end taxes on overtime pay if reelected | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:16 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T23:15:55.275Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/trump-overtime-pay-taxes/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would push for legislation that would end taxes on overtime pay if he wins a second term. “Today, I’m also announcing that as part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime. You know what that means? Think of that,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona. “That gives people more of an incentive to work. It gives the companies a lot, it’s a lot easier to get the people,” Trump said in his first rally since his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this week. His pitch came in battleground Arizona, where Harris’ ascendance on the ticket has put the state — which President Joe Biden won by just 10,000 votes — back in play for Democrats this year. The former president previously announced he would push to end taxes on tips and proposed that seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security benefits. “The people who work overtime are among the hardest working citizens in our country and for too long, no one in Washington has been looking out for them,” Trump said. “Those are the people, they really work. They’re police officers, nurses, factory workers, construction workers, truck drivers and machine operators.” The Harris campaign quickly countered that Trump, as president, denied overtime pay for millions of workers and warned that if he wins a second term, fewer workers would receive overtime. “Trump tried to rip away overtime pay for nearly 10 million workers and devastated families,” said Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Joseph Costello in a statement. “A second term will be even worse: Trump’s Project 2025 Agenda would allow employers to stop paying many workers overtime.” Harris’ claim references a 2016 effort by then-President Barack Obama to overhaul federal overtime rules and raise the salary threshold to about $47,500 a year, or $913 a week. That would have roughly doubled the level that was in place at the time. But business groups and 21 states sued, and later that year, a federal judge in Texas issued an injunction The Trump administration said in 2017 that it would not defend the rule in appellate court. Two years later, the Trump administration lifted the threshold to roughly $35,600 a year, or $684 per week, making an estimated 1.2 million more people eligible – nearly 3 million fewer workers than would have been eligible under Obama’s rule. If Trump wins a second term, he would once again have to decide whether to defend his predecessor’s overtime rule. The Biden administration in April finalized a rule that would raise the threshold to the equivalent of an annual salary of roughly $43,900, or $844 a week, starting July 1, and then to about $58,700, or $1,128 a week, on January 1, 2025. Biden’s rule is also facing several legal challenges, which are winding their way through the courts. This story has been updated with additional details."
US expected to charge Iranian hackers who targeted Trump campaign | CNN Politics,"Published 6:34 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T22:34:47.154Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/charges-expected-hackers-trump-campaign/index.html,"The Justice Department is expected to soon announce criminal charges against the Iranian government-backed hackers who carried out a hack-and-leak operation targeting former President Donald Trump’s campaign, four sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The criminal charges against the Iranian hackers could be unveiled as soon as next week, two of the sources said. The Iranian hackers stole internal Trump campaign documents and shared them with news organizations in an attempt to sow discord during the presidential election, according to US officials. The hackers breached the email account of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone to target campaign staff in June, CNN has reported. US officials believe the hackers work for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. CNN has requested comment from the Justice Department on the pending move against the hackers. The expected US prosecution, which was first reported by The Washington Post, is part of a full-fledged US government effort to expose covert foreign influence activities aimed at the 2024 election cycle before they can have an impact on voters. US officials last week announced charges against employees of Russian state media outlet RT accused of secretly funding a media company that amplified right-wing American influencers. In a speech at Columbia Law School Thursday, the Justice Department’s top national security official, Matthew Olsen, warned of an “onslaught” by authoritarian regimes trying to influence the upcoming election. “Right now, our adversaries are actively taking steps to covertly influence our elections and undermine our democracy,” Olsen said. “Authoritarian regimes — including Russian, Iran and China — are determined to warp the views of the electorate in advance of upcoming elections in ways that they believe will serve their own interests and weaken the United States.” US officials were largely caught flat-footed in reacting to Russian influence operations aimed at the 2016 election and were slow to publicly expose the activity. Some of the same US officials are trying to avoid making that mistake this year."
"Biden dons Trump hat, jokes about his age and false rumors about Ohio pets during Pennsylvania trip | CNN Politics","Published 5:06 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T21:06:56.227Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/biden-dons-trump-hat-pennsylvania/index.html,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday donned a Trump hat in what the White House described as a good-natured gesture of bipartisan unity during the anniversary of the September 11 attacks – a light-hearted moment in what has otherwise been an extremely toxic political campaign. The interaction took place at a firehouse near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where United Flight 93 crashed into a rural field after passengers tried thwarting its hijacking 23 years ago. Video of the interaction shows Biden glad-handing with people inside the firehouse, including a man in a Trump hat. Biden hands the man a presidential hat, and the man asks him to autograph it. “Do you remember your name?” the man jokingly asks the president. Biden responds as an aide hands him a Sharpie: “I don’t remember my name. I’m slow.” “You’re an old fart,” the man says. “Yeah, I know, I’m an old guy,” Biden responds. “I know you would know about that.” Both men laugh, as does the gathered crowd. The video shows several children in the background wearing Trump-branded shirts. Biden signs the presidential hat and tells the man he needs his Trump cap. The man obliges and asks the president if he would like his autograph. Biden responds: “Hell no.” The crowd urges the president to put the Trump hat on over a Shanksville Volunteer Fire Co. Station 627 cap he’s already wearing. The president initially says, “I ain’t going that far,” before obliging the crowd’s requests to laughter and applause. “I’m proud of you now,” the man says while shaking Biden’s hand. Biden tells the crowd: “Just remember, no eating dogs and cats,” an apparent reference to a false rumor the Trump campaign, former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance have promoted about Haitian immigrants in Ohio. Groans are audible in the background at that line. Biden walks away, still holding the Trump hat. The person who posted the video said in a TikTok comment that the president kept the hat. Efforts to reach the poster and the man in the video were not immediately successful Thursday. It was one one of the few times since becoming president that Biden has interacted and bantered with a crowd of mainly Trump supporters; the bulk of his public appearances have involved well-heeled Democratic donors or staunch supporters of the president and his policies. It was the kind of retail politics that the president has made his signature throughout his long career. “At the Shanksville Fire Station, @POTUS spoke about the country’s bipartisan unity after 9/11 and said we needed to get back to that,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a post on X. “As a gesture, he gave a hat to a Trump supporter who then said that in the same spirit, POTUS should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it.” Trump’s campaign tried capitalizing on the moment, thanking Biden for his support in a social media post. It wasn’t the only interaction that day that showed a sign of cordialness as the nation remembered a tragic day. Earlier Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump briefly shook hands at a commemoration at Ground Zero in Manhattan. It came the day after Trump and Harris faced off on the debate stage in Philadelphia. During that debate, Trump said he considered sending Harris one of his hats because he claimed she has copied many of his policies. “Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window. She’s going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat,” Trump said."
Judge throws out two charges Trump faces in Georgia election subversion case | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:35 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T20:18:12.379Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/trump-georgia-election-subversion-charges/index.html,"A judge on Thursday threw out three charges in the sweeping Georgia election subversion case, including two charges that former President Donald Trump faces. The decision hasn’t yet been formally applied to Trump because his case has been paused pending appeals. In a separate ruling, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee also upheld the marquee racketeering charge in the case, which Trump is also facing. Trump lawyer Steve Sadow hailed the rulings as a victory. “President Trump and his legal team in Georgia have prevailed once again,” Sadow said in a statement. “The trial court has decided that counts 15 and 27 in the indictment must be quashed/dismissed.” McAfee threw out one count of filing false documents and one count of conspiring to file false documents, both stemming from the Trump campaign’s efforts to put forward a slate of fake GOP electors in Georgia. Trump was only named in the conspiracy count. In the ruling, McAfee also threw out a separate count of filing false documents, which Trump was charged with. That count relates to untrue statements about supposed voter fraud that were included in one of Trump’s lawsuits in December 2020 that attempted to negate the election results. These rulings only narrowly took effect for former Trump lawyer John Eastman and Georgia state Sen. Shawn Still, who were involved in the 2020 fake electors plot. Their cases are not currently paused. Trump was only named in two of the three charges that McAfee threw out Thursday. The awkward ruling from McAfee comes as he has only partial jurisdiction over the 2020 election meddling case. Trump and most of his remaining co-defendants are seeking to have an appeals court disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from overseeing the case. So, their cases are paused with McAfee, who presides in a lower court. But two defendants, Eastman and Still, opted to move ahead with their cases in the lower court rather than join the appeal over whether Willis should be prosecuting the case. Willis, a Democrat, originally secured a 13-count indictment against Trump last summer, related to his multi-pronged attempts to overturn his 2020 defeat in the Peach State. McAfee already threw out three of Trump’s charges in March. Willis’ office declined to comment. McAfee’s chambers did not immediately return a request for additional clarification.

Trump says he won’t participate in another presidential debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:24 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T19:34:28.762Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/donald-trump-no-third-debate/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he would not participate in another presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. “THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!” Trump posted on Truth Social, referencing his first face-off with President Joe Biden in June and his second with Harris on Tuesday. Harris’ campaign had called for another debate after the vice president and Trump faced off at ABC’s presidential debate in Philadelphia. Harris reiterated that call during a rally in Charlotte on Thursday, saying, “I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important.” But Trump on Thursday appeared to end speculation about whether another debate would take place, saying that Harris “SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEAR PERIOD.” The Harris campaign said it does not take Trump’s announcement that there will not be another presidential debate at face value. “He changes his position every day,” said a senior Harris adviser. “I predict there will be another.” Following their Philadelphia debate, Trump defended his performance to reporters, claiming the ABC moderators were “very unfair” and that it was “three-on-one” during the debate. The next day on Fox News, Trump said he didn’t know if he wanted to participate in another debate as he continued to claim he had “won.” “In the World of Boxing or UFC, when a Fighter gets beaten or knocked out, they get up and scream, ‘I DEMAND A REMATCH, I DEMAND A REMATCH!’ Well, it’s no different with a Debate. She was beaten badly last night. Every Poll has us WINNING,” Trump wrote Wednesday on Truth Social. According to a CNN Fact Check, as of Thursday morning, every major scientific poll about the debate had found that Harris won. That included a CNN/SSRS flash poll of registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate, who broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who endorsed Trump after suspending his own bid, said on Fox News that while Trump won the debate on “substance,” Harris “clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization and her preparation.” Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the respective running mates of Trump and Harris, are scheduled to face off in a debate hosted by CBS on October 1.

"Laura Loomer, far-right provocateur who spread 9/11 conspiracy theory, influencing Trump as he searches for a message | CNN Politics","Updated 5:10 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T16:14:17.312Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/laura-loomer-donald-trump-influence/index.html,"As Donald Trump mingled and posed for pictures with firefighters on Wednesday – one of several stops to observe the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States – a small entourage of the former president’s inner circle looked on from outside Engine Company 4 Ladder Company 15 in New York City. The group included the two most powerful individuals in Trump’s orbit, his co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. Standing near them was another figure whose sway with the Republican nominee also cannot be discounted: the far-right provocateur Laura Loomer. Of all the days to count Loomer as a travel companion, September 11 was notable. Last year, she posted a video on social media claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an “inside job,” an illogical but pervasive conspiracy theory that continues to haunt the families of victims and survivors. Her anti-Muslim social media posts eventually earned her a ban from Twitter that lasted until billionaire Elon Musk bought the website, now known as X, and restored her account. Asked why Loomer joined Trump for his Patriot Day travels in New York and then Pennsylvania, a campaign official declined to directly address her presence and instead focused on the bipartisan appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden. “The day wasn’t about anyone other than the souls who are no longer with us, their families, and the heroes who courageously stepped up to save their fellow Americans on that fateful day,” the official said. Loomer, in a phone interview with CNN, said, “I don’t understand what the issue is about me going to a 9/11 memorial. In fact, the people who greeted President Trump at the memorial, were very happy to see me, and they said, ‘Thank you for coming.’” She added, “I’ve never denied the fact that Islamic terrorists carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In fact, the media calls me anti Muslim precisely for the reason that I spend so much time focusing on talking about the threats of Islamic terrorism in America.” Loomer’s proximity on Wednesday was illustrative of her influence with Trump of late. She knows his personal number and has utilized it, one source familiar with the relationship told CNN. (Another source insisted she is respectful of his team and goes through the regular channels when she’s trying to reach him.) She’s been on a handful of trips with him, appears often at events where he is speaking and there have been times her bombastic social media posts have appeared to preview Trump’s next line of attack. The former president has long embraced conspiracy theories and has regularly aligned himself with those who peddle in them, especially if they support him. He entered the political arena as one of the leading purveyors of myths about President Barack Obama’s birthplace. And after he lost the 2020 election, Trump surrounded himself with people who claimed with questionable or debunked evidence they could prove he won. But several people close to the former president say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories Trump has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket, a change that has left the GOP nominee increasingly unsettled by the political landscape he now faces. “He wasn’t the one who came up with that talking point,” an adviser said when Trump questioned Harris’ ethnicity at an especially tense interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. The adviser pointed the finger at Loomer, who had baselessly accused Harris on X of hiding her Black heritage leading up to Trump’s appearance. Others pushed back on the notion she was behind Trump’s remarks. “I don’t think it’s racist to mock the fact that Kamala Harris panders to every single group of people who she encounters in an effort to try to convince them that she shares their same identity,” Loomer told CNN. She did not weigh in on whether she influenced Trump’s remarks. When Trump landed in Philadelphia on Tuesday before his debate against Harris, Loomer was among the close allies seen deboarding his private plane. Some saw it as no coincidence that hours later, an erratic Trump exclaimed from the debate stage that immigrants were “eating the pets” of Ohioans, referencing a fast-escalating rumor about Haitian migrants circulated this week by the online right, including Loomer. Trump’s own running mate, Sen. JD Vance, had spread that false claim before acknowledging on Tuesday that it may not be true. Trump surprised some of his advisers when he brought the rumors to the debate stage Tuesday night, sources familiar with the situation told CNN. But while some Trump allies admitted post-debate that the back-and-forth wasn’t helpful, Trump advisers doubled down, claiming the storyline aids their effort to put the spotlight on migrant crime in the US. Two days before the debate, Loomer said that if Harris, who is half Indian, wins, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” It was a bridge too far even for Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a notorious firebrand herself known to promote conspiracy theories, who wrote on social media that Loomer’s post was “appalling and extremely racist.” She added: “It does not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA.” Loomer told CNN of the post: “It’s interesting how the media wants to, once again, falsely accuse me of being a racist. This is a woman who is on video cooking Indian food with Indian celebrities talking about how she likes cooking with curry.” Trump’s embrace of Loomer has baffled many conservatives who believe her antics are harmful to the mission of getting the Republican elected. Steve Deace, a conservative podcast host, told CNN that Loomer “offers absolutely nothing to Donald Trump other than a lot of collateral damage on social media that provokes people to not want to vote for him who should be.” “She is the manifestation of the point of diminishing returns,” he added. Loomer has made a career out of courting controversy. Rising out of the radical right-wing online ecosystem, she has regularly tested the willingness of internet companies to enforce their terms of service. She once described herself as a “proud Islamophobe” and tweeted in 2018 that “someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver.” She was eventually banned from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Loomer told CNN she is not “anti-Muslim.” She twice ran for Congress in her home state of Florida, including once to represent Trump’s home in Mar-a-Lago, almost exclusively campaigning on her allegiance to the former president. She lost both races. Her unyielding loyalty to Trump was on full display during the GOP primary, when she heckled Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at public appearances with a bullhorn and spread unfounded claims about his wife’s cancer diagnosis online. Even as LaCivita and Wiles have managed to marginalize many of the interlopers who clung to Trump’s first two White House bids, Loomer has endured. In August of last year, Trump even suggested the campaign hire Loomer for an official role, sources told CNN at the time. His advisers and allies, outraged by the idea, shot it down and she was never brought on. On social media, Loomer has stressed she doesn’t work for the political operation, saying she is “simply a loyal advocate” and believes Trump deserves “unconditional loyalty.” Yet, the Trump stalwart has managed nearly unrestricted access to the former president as he seeks the country’s highest office once again. Trump spotted her in the crowd at a cryptocurrency conference this summer and praised her, telling the audience, “She’s a fantastic person, great woman.” “He likes her,” a person close to Trump said. “Remember, last year there was a discussion about potentially hiring her. She hasn’t been hired but it’s not abnormal some of these people end up on the plane for a day or two.” While Loomer’s travel with Trump reflects her elevated status within his orbit, it has caused tension among some in Trump’s inner circle. Since the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, earlier this summer, a stepped-up security presence on Trump’s Boeing 757 has meant fewer seats for advisers and allies. The arrangement has miffed some advisers and allies forced to fly commercial to Trump events, while giving the appearance, at least internally, of a special standing to those granted a coveted seat onboard what’s known as “Trump Force One.” Loomer told CNN she also accompanied Trump on the plane the day after his assassination attempt. “He wanted me on the plane with him the day after he almost got assassinated. I was with him. I flew with him to the (Republican National Convention), so it could show that I’m a trustworthy person, I have his back,” Loomer said. With the exception of Loomer, those who were seen coming off the plane with him at Tuesday’s debate were his closest aides and advisers, and those that had helped prepare him for the face off with Harris – Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, former Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and longtime adviser Stephen Miller."
Fact check: Trump falsely claims every poll says he won the debate | CNN Politics,"Published 12:39 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T16:39:12.470Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/fact-check-trump-claims-won-debate/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump has returned to a time-honored tradition of his: citing junk online polls to claim he was the clear winner of a presidential debate that scientific polls found he lost. He did it in 2016 after his debates against Hillary Clinton. He did it in 2020 after he debated Joe Biden. And he did it again on Wednesday after facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris the previous night. He wrote on social media on Wednesday afternoon: “Every Poll has us WINNING, in one case, 92-8, so why would I do a Rematch?” “We won the debate according to every poll — every single poll, I think,” Trump told reporters later in the afternoon. Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. As of Thursday morning, every major scientific poll about the debate — every poll that used random sampling techniques to try to obtain a representative picture of US public opinion — had found that Harris won. The polls in which most respondents said Trump won were unscientific junk polls — open questions posted online — that allowed an unlimited number of people to click and respond no matter how old they are or what country they live in, making the results useless as a measure of US public opinion. Here are the results of three scientific polls about the debate from established nonpartisan pollsters. The first two were released before Trump made his Wednesday claims that every poll showed him winning. CNN poll conducted by SSRS (605 registered voters who said they watched): 63% said Harris did a better job in the debate, 37% said Trump did a better job. YouGov poll (2,166 registered voters who said they watched): 54% said Harris won the debate, 31% said Trump won, 14% weren’t sure. Leger poll for the New York Post (1,002 US adults who said they watched): 50% said Harris won the debate, 29% said Trump won, 21% said nobody won or that they didn’t know. Scientific debate polls from a Democratic pollster and a Republican pollster also found Harris ahead. So while scientific polls are certainly imperfect, it’s clear that Trump’s claim that he won the debate “according to every poll” is wrong. Trump was citing junk polls Trump indicated on social media on debate night and in a Fox News interview the next day that — as he has in the two previous presidential elections — he was citing junk polls as the basis for his claims that polls showed he was the clear debate winner. Trump said on Fox that “every single poll last night had me winning like 90 to 10” and “we have one here: 92 to 7.” Here’s an example of one poll that had him winning by a massive margin like that: an unscientific web survey from Newsmax, a right-wing television station that invited viewers to go to its website and say who they thought won. Such polls are used by media outlets and social media accounts to generate engagement among their audiences. That’s fine. But the polls’ uselessness as an accurate gauge of public opinion is obvious. Newsmax fans were more likely to know this poll even existed than other people were. People could vote multiple times if they owned multiple web-connected devices. And people could vote even if they are a child or a foreign citizen living somewhere else in the world. In the Fox interview, Trump also cited an 80-20 lead he said he had at one point in a C-SPAN poll. C-SPAN is a nonpartisan entity that broadcasts the proceedings of the federal government. But its poll, too, was a junk poll; C-SPAN simply posted an open question on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Supporters of either candidate, no matter where in the world, could share the C-SPAN link with an unlimited number of like-minded people."
Harris campaign seizes on abortion exchange in Tuesday’s debate in new ad | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T16:00:19.725Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/harris-campaign-seizes-abortion-ad-debate/index.html,"The Harris campaign is launching a new abortion-focused ad Thursday, capitalizing on what officials believe was one of the most pivotal exchanges between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump during Tuesday’s presidential debate. Harris’ team prepared the vice president to confront Trump on nationwide abortion restrictions. Her aides argue the preparation paid off, crediting her needling him on reproductive rights for throwing him off balance the rest of the debate. And now, they’re turning that moment into an ad that will run in battleground states, including in Arizona and Nevada where Trump heads this week. The newly released ad includes both candidates’ responses on abortion on the debate stage. “I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,” Trump said, referring to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Harris, in response, ran through personal stories of women struggling to get health care while navigating abortion restrictions. “I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body should not be made by the government,” she said. Campaign officials cited the vice president’s response as one of the strongest moments of the debate, based on internal data suggesting that the stories of miscarriages and victims of rape and incest resonated the most with undecided voters. In a statement announcing the ad, Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said abortion is “one of the top issues in this election, and the difference between the candidates could not be clearer.” It comes as Harris arrives in North Carolina – a crucial state that President Joe Biden narrowly lost in 2020 but one where campaign officials say they’re trying to make inroads with voters who may be put off by Trump and controversial GOP gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson. North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny Tuesday he believes Harris will move the needle in his battleground state after her strong showing in Philadelphia. The vice president’s focus on protecting abortion rights and health care, Cooper said, could be key to bolstering Democratic efforts to deliver the state in a presidential race for the first time since 2008. Harris campaign officials spent Wednesday poring over footage of the debate to identify key moments to put into new campaign TV and digital ads, according to the campaign, seeking to amplify what they perceive to be the strongest debate exchange. The latest ads are part of $370 million set aside for digital and television between Labor Day and Election Day."
The origins of Trump’s false claim that Democrats want to allow ‘execution’ of babies after birth | CNN,"Published 11:32 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T15:32:39.357Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/health/trump-abortion-after-birth/index.html,"At Tuesday night’s presidential debate, when former President Donald Trump was asked about his stance on abortion access, he offered a now-familiar explanation for his support for gestational abortion limits early in pregnancy and for overturning Roe v. Wade: the idea that, otherwise, after-birth execution of newborns would be allowed. “You can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia,” Trump said. “He said ‘the baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we’ll execute the baby.’ ” Linsey Davis of ABC News, one of the debate’s moderators, responded with a fact check: “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.” So where did Trump’s claim about executing newborn babies — one he also made in CNN’s June 27 debate against President Joe Biden — come from? It appears to stem from comments made by former Virginia (not West Virginia) Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat and pediatric neurologist, in an interview with Washington, DC, radio station WTOP in 2019. Northam was asked about a proposed bill that would eliminate certain requirements around access to abortion in the second and third trimesters, and specifically about comments from the bill’s sponsor acknowledging that it would allow abortions up until just before birth. Northam noted that abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy are “done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that’s nonviable. So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen: The infant would be delivered; the infant would be kept comfortable; the infant would be resuscitated, if that’s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” Northam’s comments generated backlash at the time from Republican leaders, with former Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel writing on X, then known as Twitter, that he was “defending born-alive abortions.” Northam’s office at the time accused Republicans of taking his comments out of context, saying he was referring to “tragic or difficult circumstances, such as a nonviable pregnancy or in the event of severe fetal abnormalities, and the governor’s comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman in those circumstances went into labor.” The bill never became law. Abortions are currently legal in Virginia until the third trimester. Five years later, Trump appears to be citing that interview as evidence of what he calls Democrats’ “radical” position on abortion access; his campaign didn’t respond immediately to an inquiry about it from CNN this week. But clinicians and researchers in reproductive medicine told CNN that his comments are a dramatic misinterpretation of reality. “It’s obviously untrue,” said Dr. Diane Horvath, chief medical officer of Partners in Abortion Care in College Park, Maryland, a clinic that provides abortions up to 34 weeks of pregnancy. “This is the same kind of tired trope that keeps getting brought out, and the purpose of it is to scare people into thinking that something nefarious is happening with medical care in this country,” she said. Abortions later in pregnancy are rare: Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2021 shows that 94% of abortions were performed before 13 weeks of pregnancy, within the first trimester - with the majority of those, 80% of the total, happening before nine weeks. Less than 1% — 0.9% — were reported as being provided after 21 weeks, the CDC data says. That was about 4,070 abortions. However, as Horvath pointed out, the CDC’s data comes from voluntary reporting by states and doesn’t include California and Maryland, where later-pregnancy abortion is more accessible, so its numbers are incomplete and probably undercount abortions provided later in pregnancy. Northam didn’t respond this week to CNN’s requests for comment about his statements, but Horvath described the circumstances that he appeared to be referring to — when a baby is born but not expected to live very long — as “hospice for babies.” “What I believe he was talking about are incredibly tragic circumstances where the family receives a fetal diagnosis that is incompatible with sustained life,” she explained. “These families want to be able to spend time with their dying babies and have them get comfort care so they can pass away peacefully. … We give the same palliative care to a dying baby that we give to your dying grandma.” Dr. Katrina Kimport, a sociologist and professor in the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health or ANSIRH program at the University of California, San Francisco, has conducted interviews with people who’ve sought abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy as part of her research. She described one woman who learned that the fetus she was carrying had “a very serious fetal health diagnosis; it was very likely that the fetus was going to die in utero, but there was a chance it would be born alive and then, within a couple of hours, would die.” The woman’s “fervent desire,” Kimport recalled, “was to continue the pregnancy and maybe have the opportunity to hold her baby, to give birth, maybe give palliative care and ease its suffering.” She lived in a state that had what Kimport referred to as a “born alive law,” which required any babies born alive to be offered all available interventions in an attempt to save them. So, Kimport said, the woman “was told that because of the law in her state, she would not be allowed to [give birth the way she wanted], and if she insisted on that, the state would take away her baby from her.” The woman ultimately left the state to have an abortion, Kimport said. It’s generally nobody’s desire to have an abortion in the third trimester, Horvath told CNN. “People who want an abortion want it as soon as they can have it,” she said. People who seek them out typically fall into two categories, she said: those who’ve received “new information,” and those who sought abortions earlier but faced barriers to access that caused delays. New information, she noted, could be about the health of the fetus, their own health or life circumstances that have changed, such as a partner who has become violent. Horvath pointed out that a “leading cause of death for pregnant people is homicide.” CDC data shows that 2% of pregnancy-related deaths in 2020 were determined to be from homicide. She also noted that it’s not as uncommon as it may seem for people to not realize they’re pregnant until the later stages of pregnancy, particularly if they’re very young. And barriers to care can mean people who sought abortions earlier are unable to obtain them until later in pregnancy. Kimport described another person she interviewed who initially tried to get an abortion at 11 weeks but lived in a state where Medicaid wouldn’t cover abortions, and she didn’t have enough money to get the procedure otherwise. “By the time she was able to raise the funds she needed, she was farther along,” Kimport said, “so the procedure was more clinically complex and expensive.” There are fewer providers who perform abortions later in pregnancy, so the woman also had to travel. “She was after 24 weeks by the time all of that came together,” Kimport said. Those kinds of barriers, she noted, “have only gotten more strong” since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. “That’s what an abortion ban is.” CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report."
New York appeals court rejects two more attempts by Trump to lift gag order | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:40 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T14:06:03.333Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/new-york-appeals-court-rejects-two-more-attempts-by-trump-to-lift-gag-order/index.html,"New York’s highest court rejected two separate attempts to hear Donald Trump’s appeals on the gag order in his hush money case, according to a decision list posted Thursday. The gag order, issued by Judge Juan Merchan in the criminal case against the former president, remains in effect, although Merchan lifted portions of it in June. Trump is currently limited from discussing any specific prosecutor, court staffer or their family members. Trump’s attorneys had challenged both the initial gag order and the modified gag order. The Court of Appeals judges wrote that they declined to hear the case about the modified gag order because “no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.” Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that the former president “will continue to fight against the unconstitutional Witch Hunts and Gag Orders.” Cheung placed blame on Democrats “because they know he is dominating this election.” Trump was found guilty earlier this year of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sentencing in the case has been delayed until late November. This story has been updated with additional information."
Mr ChatGPT and other AI power players are going to the White House to discuss AI’s massive thirst for energy | CNN Business,"Updated 9:11 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T11:00:22.129Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/tech/ai-chatgpt-white-house-power-energy/index.html,"The face of artificial intelligence in America is set to meet with top US officials at the White House on Thursday, CNN has learned, in a first-of-its-kind meeting to solve a riddle that could severely strain US infrastructure: how to power the AI boom. Sam Altman, the CEO behind ChatGPT maker Open AI, Google senior executive Ruth Porat and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei are expected to be among the tech executives in attendance, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. The meeting, which hasn’t been previously reported, is the first time senior White House officials will sit down with tech company leadership to discuss how to quench AI’s insatiable thirst for energy. The source said the White House expects to detail how the public and private sector can work together to maintain US leadership in AI in a sustainable way. The effort shows how business leaders and government officials are being forced to confront emerging challenges posed by the AI boom, which has captivated investors on Wall Street. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other top officials from the Biden-Harris administration are also set to attend, along with representatives from Microsoft, according to a White House official. Neither President Joe Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to attend. The rapid development of energy-intensive AI has sparked worries about the technology straining America’s aging power grid at a time when the Biden administration is attempting to speed the transition away from coal and other fossil fuels. Although AI has the potential to solve thorny problems like the climate crisis and cancer, it poses equally complex challenges, including how to meet the significant demand for electricity required by advanced AI systems. A single request on ChatGPT consumes about 10 times as much electricity as a typical Google search, according to the International Energy Agency. By 2026, the AI industry is projected to consume at least 10 times as much as in 2023, the IEA said. AI is expected to spark a 160% surge in power demand from data centers by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. AI’s appetite for energy is so great that it will force long-stalled US power demand to increase significantly the rest of this decade, the bank has said. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to CNN that Altman plans to attend the meeting and will focus on how building out America’s AI infrastructure — power generation, data centers and semiconductor manufacturing — will create jobs. In a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, Altman described the question of who will control the future of AI as “the urgent question of our time.” “The United States currently has a lead in AI development,” Altman wrote, “but continued leadership is far from guaranteed. Authoritarian governments the world over are willing to spend enormous amounts of money to catch up and ultimately overtake us.” Altman has a lot at stake in this issue. Not only is he the face of the AI industry, but he has invested in Exowatt, a startup that is betting solar power can help shrink AI’s carbon footprint. Exowatt just launched a new system that can generate and store clean energy to AI data centers. “President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to deepening US leadership in AI by ensuring data centers are built in the United States while ensuring the technology is developed responsibly,” White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson told CNN in a statement. Other US officials expected to attend Thursday’s AI power meeting include White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and top climate officials Ali Zaidi and John Podesta. The meeting follows a July 2023 effort by the Biden administration to get leading AI companies to pledge to put new AI systems through outside testing before public release and clearly label AI-generated content. It’s a big day for Sam Altman: He will appear on an 8 pm ET special about AI on ABC hosted by Oprah Winfrey. Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates will also appear on the show."
Trump allies do damage control as Harris rides fresh momentum post-debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:19 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T04:00:19.736Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/trump-harris-debate-fallout-analysis/index.html,"Ex-President Donald Trump is equivocating over the possibility of a second debate with Kamala Harris after his dud display in their first showdown prompted his team and conservative media allies to mount a frantic cleanup operation. It’s far too early to say whether the tangle in Philadelphia substantially changed the race as Harris beseeches remaining movable voters in swing states to ditch the chaos of the Trump era. But in the aftermath of Tuesday’s debate, both campaigns are surveying the impact of a critical clash before more than 60 million viewers eight weeks from Election Day. Trump, who took multiple victory laps following President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, found himself facing the kind of inquest endured by his erstwhile rival. While the ex-president’s campaign will not suffer the same fate as Biden’s shuttered reelection effort, the debate was the latest sign that Trump is still failing to focus on the new challenges posed by Harris and make his own best case. The vice president was basking in a fresh jolt of euphoria among Democrats who perceive an oft-doubted political figure growing in stature with every test she passes. Harris’ campaign is also leveraging the endorsement of Taylor Swift, which could open a new seam of interest among the pop megastar’s loyal fanbase. But history suggests that a first debate between two candidates is not historically a reliable predictor of who wins the election. Despite Harris’ strong performance, it’s not yet clear how much progress she made in building the path to 270 electoral votes. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, who consistently warns Democrats not to take her swing state for granted, told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on Thursday that Trump’s base is energized and that the race could not be closer. “I was ecstatic, like every other Democrat, as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin. He reminded much of America about who he was and what he was. She showed people she could be the commander in chief,” Dingell said. But, she added: “At 6:50 yesterday morning, one of my township supervisors called me and wanted to know what I thought. And I said, ‘Well, what did you think?’ And that discussion brought me right back down to Earth.” “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” she said. Meanwhile, Harris’ allies are reinforcing the tone of mockery and attempts to goad Trump that emerged at the Democratic National Convention and that the vice president carried into the debate. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played Trump in Harris’ debate prep, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the ex-president has slowed mentally since 2016 and compared him to a “malfunctioning appliance.” “He was all over the place but to some extent structured,” Reines said, referring to Trump when he took on former Secretary of State Clinton. “Now, he’s all over the board.” He added: “I think he’s losing (his) train of thought and he’s just blurting out the next thing in his mind.” Hours after the debate, the political bile briefly eased as Harris and Trump, along with Biden and Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, gathered at Ground Zero in New York to honor the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The general election rivals only met for the first time at the debate, but they shared their second handshake in 12 hours in a gesture of national unity orchestrated by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. In a more light-hearted scene Wednesday, a grinning Biden took the extraordinary step of donning a Trump 2024 baseball cap. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said the president gave a hat to a Trump supporter during a visit to a fire station in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, near where the fourth hijacked jet crashed short of its target on 9/11 after a passenger revolt. The Trump supporter had said that “in the same spirit POTUS should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it,” Bates said. But it was only a temporary respite to the bitter fallout from the debate. The former president did what he always does when presented with unfavorable political facts — deny them. He declared on Fox News on Wednesday that he had “one of my better debates,” despite sweeping negative reviews of his showing. Trump also launched an attack on ABC News, claiming the debate was “rigged” and faulting moderators who fact checked him for setting up a “three-to-one” tag team against him. But one of his newest associates, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., may have inadvertently highlighted Trump’s deficiencies in the debate even as he tried to praise the ex-president whom he recently endorsed. Kennedy said on Fox News that while Trump won the debate on “substance,” Harris “clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization and her preparation.” “I think on substance, President Trump wins in terms of his governance,” Kennedy said. “But he didn’t tell that story.” Still, Trump’s complaints were more eagerly picked up among his longtime boosters in conservative media, underscoring the way that the Republican Party always falls in line behind its leader. However, Trump’s narrative that he was thwarted by two TV anchors sat uneasily with his claim on stage that he’s such an intimidating figure that US enemies were simply scared of him. Trump was correct in arguing that he was fact-checked more thoroughly than Harris on Tuesday night by moderators who missed several chances to correct the vice president or to hold her to account for dodging questions. But Harris said nothing that compared to the gusher of untruths from the former president, which included a claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were slaying and eating residents’ dogs and cats. (That racist claim was debunked Wednesday by Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who said there was “no credible evidence.”) Adopting a more sinister tone in his interview with Fox, the former president accused ABC of putting on a “rigged deal” and warned officials “ought to take away their license.” His comments were ominous considering he’s vowed to wage a presidency of “retribution” if he is elected to a second term in November that would include the use of presidential power to punish his enemies. The former president also Wednesday publicly toyed with the idea of a second debate, after the Harris campaign challenged him to another round. But the former president, smarting from his treatment at the hands of the vice president on Tuesday, doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to renew the performance. One the one hand, he may have little incentive to show up again given that he was widely seen to have suffered a drubbing on Tuesday. But if the polls show him trailing in the run-up to the election, there might be a rationale for a do-over. The Harris campaign has a similar conundrum. There’s a case for the vice president folding her tent given that she might not be able to repeat Tuesday’s performance. Trump, however, is trying to change perceptions of the debate after the fact. “In the World of Boxing or UFC, when a Fighter gets beaten or knocked out, they get up and scream, ‘I DEMAND A REMATCH, I DEMAND A REMATCH!’ Well, it’s no different with a Debate. She was beaten badly last nigh. Every Poll has us WINNING,” he wrote on Truth Social, “so why would I do a Rematch?” As is often the case, the ex-president’s reading of polls was exaggerated. A flash CNN poll performed by SSRS after the debate found that watchers thought Harris put in a stronger performance by 63% to 37%. History suggests that it takes at least a week for the full impact of a debate to filter down into the electorate. And the fundamentals of the neck-and-neck race with Harris still seem to favor the former president, whose campaign ads are targeting the vice president over the current administration’s record on the economy, including high prices, inflation and immigration, with an intensity and level of focus that Trump as a candidate has come nowhere near matching. Trump’s running mate has also been more effective at delivering a sharp political message than his boss. He weaved a dismissal of the Swift endorsement for Harris into a wider attack on the vice president on Fox News. “When grocery prices go by up by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn’t hurt Taylor Swift,” Vance said. “When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn’t affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country.” The challenging political backdrop explains why things are still tense at Harris headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. A senior campaign aide told CNN’s MJ Lee that the assumption was that the election remained a 50-50 proposition. “It’ll be incredibly close. We cannot take our foot off the gas, even when the moment feels really good,” the aide said. Harris also faces choices beyond whether she’ll agree to another debate. While her performance was stylistically strong on Tuesday, she still dodged key questions — for instance, the very first one on whether she believes Americans are better off now or when Trump was in office. The Trump campaign is sure to keep up its drumbeat of complaints that she’s avoiding deeper media scrutiny. And there are many signs that voters want more substance from the Democratic nominee. Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, told CNN’s John King that Harris did well in the debate but several also cautioned she was not sufficiently specific in explaining her policies. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs and voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the primary. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues. Such doubts are evident in recent national polls too. But they also reflect the fresh complications Trump has caused for himself with his underwhelming debate performance: He may have squandered his best and last chance to expose Harris over those vulnerabilities in front of tens of millions of voters."

Pete Buttigieg on Thursday slammed former President Donald Trump’s recent false claims that migrants are eating pets, saying it’s a strategy to distract from the Republican presidential nominee’s record. In recent days, Trump and his allies, including running mate JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Trump repeated the conspiracy theory during the ABC presidential debate Tuesday night, although the City of Springfield and the local police have said they’ve seen no evidence for the claim. Buttigieg, who spoke in his personal capacity but serves as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, said that while he thinks it is a distraction technique, “it contributes to this bigger picture of demonizing immigrants.” Buttigieg praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance but stressed that groundwork and organizing is more important to win the race. John Legend took to Instagram to respond to Donald Trump’s baseless claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in the singer’s hometown of Springfield, Ohio. Here’s what he said: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance, while warning Michigan voters that the fight to win battleground states is not over. The Democratic vice presidential candidate said Harris “commanded the room” on Tuesday at the ABC News presidential debate. “Let’s be very clear, none of us were surprised at what happened there,” and saying “no pun intended” that Harris had the “upper hand” from the start, referencing the vice president initiating a handshake with her GOP rival. As former President Donald Trump says there will not be another presidential debate, Walz said he thinks “hell, every day we should do another one,” though, he added, “it’s not going to happen.” He asked the room if they had “eating cats” on their debate bingo cards. The crowd responded by chanting “we’re not eating cats” in the same cadence as the campaign’s now-signature “we’re not going back” chant.  His comments were in reference to a false rumor about Haitian immigrants in Ohio eating their neighbors’ cats that Trump promoted at the debate. Former President Donald Trump announced Thursday he would not participate in another presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump reiterated this during a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona, after making the announcement on social media. Harris’ campaign previously called for another debate. She doubled down on that call during a rally in Charlotte on Thursday, saying “I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important.” Here are other headlines you should know: After the debate: The Taylor Swift effect: New ads launched: Lawsuits: Trump campaign proposals: More headlines to know: A noticeable contingent of students from Bennett College were among the supporters at Vice President Kamala Harris’ Greensboro rally Friday evening.   There are nearly a dozen historically Black Colleges and Universities across North Carolina and the campaign is engaged in direct outreach with them.  Harris, a Howard University alum, recently issued a call to action to these students in an open letter.  Bennett is one of only two all-women historically Black colleges in the country. Spelman College in Georgia is the other. Self-described “proud Bennett Belle” Jasmine Rawls introduced Harris and described her excitement as a first-time voter.  “When I go to that voting booth, I will remember that Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz are the only candidates on that ballot that are fighting for a new way forward,” said Rawls. Kamiyah McDowell, 19, — who is studying elementary education — said the debate was “nerve wrecking” to watch both as a college student and as Black woman.   McDowell says she’s most fearful about “how the public is going to react to the winner.”  Former President Donald Trump on Thursday continued attacking the moderators at ABC’s presidential debate and repeated debunked conspiracy theories about migrants taking people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio.  Trump again claimed migrants in Springfield were stealing people’s pets, which is a debunked conspiracy theory that he also promoted during the presidential debate.  “They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park. In the lake. And even walking off with their pets. ‘My dog’s been taken, my dog’s been stolen,’ this can only happen, these people are the worst,” Trump said.  The GOP standard-bearer also attacked Vice President Kamala Harris over her debate performance and said, “She claimed I want to monitor women’s pregnancies. I don’t want to, I don’t want to do that. “It’s a total lie. I don’t want to do that. Women, I won’t be following you to the hospital monitoring.” For more context, here’s our fact check on the ABC presidential debate Former President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that, if reelected, he would push for legislation that would end taxes on overtime pay.  Trump said “that gives people more of an incentive to work. It gives the companies a lot, it’s a lot easier to get the people.”  The former president previously announced he would push to end taxes on tips and proposed that seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security.  GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized far-right activist Laura Loomer on Thursday, saying that her “rhetoric and hateful tone” is concerning and a problem and “doesn’t represent MAGA as a whole.” The comments from Greene, a Georgia Republican who has her own high-profile history of incendiary and inflammatory remarks, come after the congresswoman called on Loomer to take down an X post, in which Loomer said if Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who is half Indian, wins, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if she would encourage Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump not to keep close contact with Loomer, Greene said, “This is such an important election. I don’t think she has the experience or the right mentality to advise a very important presidential election.” It’s the latest sign of infighting on the far-right as the presidential election nears, highlighting tension and divisions among Trump supporters over how the Republican Party and its presidential nominee should position itself to voters. Appearing dazed and flustered by an unfamiliar and fast-changing political landscape upended by Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Trump has unleashed a torrent of mean-spirited missives, race-baiting insults and conspiratorial broadsides that even close allies and donors have acknowledged as unproductive in recent days. Loomer has been on a handful of trips with Trump, appears often at events where he is speaking and there have been times her bombastic social media posts have appeared to preview Trump’s next line of attack. Read more about Greene’s criticism here Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign raised $47 million in the 24 hours following the vice president’s debate against Donald Trump Tuesday night, according to a campaign official, making it, so far, one of the strongest single fundraising days of the vice president’s campaign.  The donations came from around 600,000 donors, the official said, and was “overwhelmingly” fueled by grassroots supporters. The official did not specify how the campaign is defining grassroots supporters. Jen O’Malley Dillon, campaign chair, said in a statement that the haul“reflects a strong and growing coalition of Americans united behind Vice President Harris’ candidacy that knows the stakes this November, and are doing their part to defeat Donald Trump this November.” However, O’Malley Dillon added that “this momentum cannot be taken for granted.”  The statement comes as CNN has previously reported that even after a strong debate performance against Trump, the Harris campaign is insisting that they believe the election will be tough and very close, and that one night would not have changed the trajectory of the race. Vice President Kamala Harris highlighted the contrasts with former President Donald Trump, criticizing him for his answers on several policy issues during his debate performance on Tuesday night while reiterating he was unfit for the presidency. During Tuesday night’s debate, Trump said he has “concepts of a plan” to replace the Affordable Care Act, something he previously promised to do. Harris responded that Trump tried dozens of times to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and touted the Biden administration’s work to work to lower prescription drug costs and cap the cost of insulin. She also said she would strengthen the ACA if she were elected president.  The vice president also noted what she said was at stake in the election, specifically women’s reproductive freedom, and reminded a crowd of supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, that Trump would not commit to vetoing an abortion ban when asked on the debate stage. Harris also slammed the former president as somebody who was “not fit to be president of the United States, and should never again occupy our nation’s highest office.” Some context: Since Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, North Carolina is again seen as competitive, and she and Trump have both campaigned there. Barack Obama won the state in 2008, the only time a Democratic candidate for the White House had carried the Tar Heel state in nearly five decades. A federal appeals court on Thursday denied former President Donald Trump’s effort to delay his sentencing in the criminal hush money case because the state judge overseeing the matter already postponed the date. Trump asked the New York-based appeals court to get involved after a federal judge denied his request to move the state case to federal court. While the case was on appeal, New York state Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees the state case, agreed to move Trump’s sentencing, then set for September 18, until after the November presidential election, in part to avoid the appearance of aiding one political party or another. The former president’s lawyers argued that even with the state adjournment, they wanted the appeals court to step in and put the case on hold until they can fully litigate their challenge to Trump’s conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records following the US Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity this summer. Rose Goute Creole restaurant does a bustling business in Springfield, Ohio, with clientele drawn to its heaping displays of patties and doughnuts, and pots of perfumed rice, fried pork and fish, and golden plantains. Rosena Jean Louis runs the front, offering free cups of a powerful black coffee and patiently managing a jostling lunch crowd. She and her coworkers are proud of the food they serve, feeding a Haitian expatriate community that has grown quickly in Springfield over the past few years. “I’m always working at the restaurant,” she told CNN. “Everyone likes the food I cook.” But when asked about a lie that has taken hold in some corners of the internet that their countrymen are stealing and eating people’s pets, she rolls her eyes in exasperation. Local officials have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” The state’s highest Republican official, Gov. Mike DeWine, also dismissed the rumor firmly on Wednesday, noting there was “no evidence of that at all.” “The internet can be quite crazy sometimes,” DeWine told CBS in an interview. “Mayor Rue of Springfield says, no, there’s no truth in that. They have no evidence of that, at all. So, I think we go with what the mayor says. He knows his city.” Read more about the debate in Springfield Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would not participate in another presidential debate.   Trump debated President Joe Biden in June and Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this week. Harris’ campaign had called for another debate after she and Trump faced off on ABC on Tuesday.  For now, the Harris campaign says it does not take Donald Trump’s comment at face value.  “He changes his position every day,” a senior adviser said. “I predict there will be another.” This post has been updated with comment from a senior Harris adviser. Asked explicitly if he would consider privatizingthe Veterans Affairs health system, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he’s in favor of giving veterans “more optionality.” “I think I’d consider — and Donald Trump was really good at this, doesn’t get enough credit for this particular innovation — but giving veterans more choice, right?” Vance said on “The Shawn Ryan Show” podcast. Vance described a situation where the nearest VA hospital might be over 100 miles away in a rural area.  Vance also spoke about gutting the federal workforce in Washington, DC, including at the VA.  “Probably 90, 95% of the people who work at the VA are fantastic human beings. But then you’ve got, like, a small slice of the VA that’s bad apples that make it really hard for everybody else to do their job,” Vance said. A judge on Thursday threw out three charges in the sweeping Georgia election subversion case, including two charges that former President Donald Trump is facing. The decision hasn’t yet been formally applied to Trump because his case has been paused pending appeals. In a separate ruling, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee also upheld the marquee racketeering charge in the case, which Trump is also facing. These rulings only narrowly went into effect for former Trump lawyer John Eastman and Georgia state Sen. Shawn Still, who were involved in the 2020 fake electors plot. Their cases are not currently paused. Trump was only named in two of the three charges that McAfee threw out Thursday. Read more about the case. President Joe Biden donned a Trump cap while visiting a firehouse in Pennsylvania on Wednesday as a gesture of “bipartisan unity” while he commemorated the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, according to press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Pictures and videos showed Biden, who was speaking to a crowd at a firehouse near Shanksville Pennsylvania – where United Flight 93 crashed after passengers tried thwarting a hijacking – momentarily putting a Trump hat on at the urging of others in the crowd. Many in the crowd were wearing Trump-branded gear. Biden’s message, Jean-Pierre said, was “that we needed to go back to that bipartisan unity as a country. And so he made those remarks, impromptu remarks, to some of the folks who were there on that day, and he offered a presidential hat to a man who was wearing a Trump cap. And in return, the man said that, in the same spirit, the president should put on his Trump cap. And so the President did very briefly, and that’s what happened.” She added: “It was, it was truly a back and forth about unity, and the president remembering a moment in time after a horrific incident on that day and how the country did come together. It didn’t matter what political party you were part of. It didn’t matter. We came together as a country because we lost so many souls, thousands of souls, more than 2,000 that day.” The White House on Thursday said recent social media comments from Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist who has been spending time with former President Donald Trump, are “repugnant.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “no leader should ever associate” with someone who spreads “racist poison.” Jean-Pierre was asked about a tweet Loomer posted on Sunday denigrating Vice President Kamala Harris. Loomer traveled to Tuesday’s presidential debate on Trump’s plane and accompanied the former president on Wednesday as he commemorated the 23rd anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. “No leader should ever associate with someone who spreads this kind of ugliness — this kind of racist poison. That’s what this is — and who continues to fan these types of dangerous and insulting conspiracy theories, like the false notion that the tragic 9/11 attacks were an inside job,” she added, a reference to a video Loomer posted last year that suggested a government conspiracy was responsible for the attacks. Read more about Loomer’s possible influence on Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris called for another presidential debate on Thursday, minutes after former President Donald Trump said on social media that he would not participate in a third debate. She slammed Trump for delivering the same “tired playbook” during the debate on Tuesday, reiterating it’s time for the country to move forward. House Republicans are flirting with the idea of forcing a government shutdown over the issue of noncitizens voting in US elections. Government funding authority runs out on September 30, and House Speaker Mike Johnson — at the all-caps urging of former President Donald Trump in social media posts – wants to pair a temporary spending bill to keep the government running along with a bill that would require proof of citizenship for every American in order to register to vote. With that in mind, here’s a look at the evidence in the specific states Johnson mentions about the infinitesimal number of undocumented people registering to vote or actually voting in US elections. Georgia In 2022, Georgia, which has more than 7 million registered voters, announced the results of the first-ever citizenship review of its voter rolls. It found a grand total of 1,634 people “who had attempted to register to vote were not able to be verified,” according to a statement that year from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican. They were placed into “pending citizenship” status. Pennsylvania In a state with more than 8.6 million registered voters, an admitted glitch in Pennsylvania’s voter registration process enabled noncitizens legally in the US to unwittingly register to vote for a time. Between 2006 and 2017, when the glitch was discovered, at least 168 unauthorized people are thought to have been registered to vote in Philadelphia, a city of more than 1.5 million people. Read about the situation in other states here Kamala Harris just roasted her opponent on national television. After months of anticipation, the world’s biggest pop star finally endorsed her. She is swimming in a veritable ocean of cash. So why is Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell still feeling anxious about November’s election? Burned before by overconfidence, Democrats this cycle are running against two opponents. Yes, Donald Trump is the name opposite of Harris’ on the ballot. But it is complacency in their own ranks that many of Harris’ allies are working just as hard to protect against in the final sprint toward Election Day. Polls provide one reason why. Surveys in battleground states indicate an extraordinarily close contest, perhaps the closest in recent memory, which many Harris allies fear is being obscured by the swell of momentum on Harris’ side. Trump’s stranglehold on his own supporters is another. Harris’ aides view his base of support as highly motivated and note his favorability is higher than when he lost the 2020 election. Yet perhaps the biggest motivator — embossed on the minds of so many operatives who now are working to elect Harris — is the memory of 2016, when Hillary Clinton’s campaign believed it was coasting to victory only to see support in the so-called “blue wall” crumble. Democrats are hardly in despair. Last month’s convention in Chicago was practically euphoric in its celebration of a new nominee that, unlike President Joe Biden, does not seem predestined to lose. And Harris herself has embraced the new sense of joy among the party, casting it as the alternative to Trump’s divisiveness. Yet in practically every conversation, public or private, Harris aides and the candidate herself have interjected with a reality check. They have tempered expectations, tamped down on confidence and announced themselves as the underdog, despite their ostensible success in orchestrating an unprecedented candidate swap 100 days before the election and consolidating new Democratic enthusiasm. Keep reading here about where things stand in the Harris campaign. Huddled at their campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after the debate, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign aides determined the event would likely do little to change the overall trajectory of the race. Their earlier projections that the results in November will amount to a razor-thin margin — likely to be as close or closer than the results in 2020 — remain the same. Instead, they have developed a plan for the coming days and weeks that will place Harris directly in front of battleground state voters, beginning Thursday in North Carolina and continuing Friday in Pennsylvania. Those stops for the “New Way Forward” tour aren’t just to any battleground state. They’re the states where voting is already about to get underway. And a campaign official tells CNN that’s no coincidence. North Carolina, a purple state where Harris and running mate Tim Walz will make two stops Thursday, is racing to reprint and send out mail-in ballots after the state’s Supreme Court ruled Monday to exclude Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has exited the race. About 161,000 people have already requested mail-in ballots, according to the NC Board of Elections. Trump won the state in 2020 by less than half that number of votes. Next week, Harris will participate in a roundtable with rank-and-file members of the influential Teamsters union, which has been withholding an endorsement for the first time in decades. She will also participate in a Q&A session with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, with whom Trump appeared in late July and remarked that Harris “turned Black.” The campaign is expecting to rake in millions in new funds, with a Harris-helmed fundraiser in Washington on Saturday, an Oprah-headlined virtual event next week and several other high-dollar events in the works, according to people familiar with them. That cash, the campaign has said, must be quickly tabulated and quickly deployed in states where voters are beginning to head to the ballot box. In addition to rallies, Harris also plans more local media interviews in swing states and appearances that bring her into direct contact with voters. Keep reading here about Harris’ campaign plans. Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris brought an immediate, tangible boost for two key websites promoting voter registration, the latest signal of the superstar singer’s political potency.  The link that Swift shared in her Instagram story late Tuesday routed fans to Vote.gov, which is the federal government’s voting registration site.  That marked a significant spike to the site’s average traffic. For instance, from September 3 to 9, the site received about 30,000 visitors per day. Vote.gov received “a total of 726,523 visitors between September 10-11, 2024,” the spokesperson noted.  The nonprofit, nonpartisan organization Vote.org also saw a significant spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement.  On Wednesday, there were over 27,000 new registrations and over 80,000 people who verified their registration status on Vote.org, a spokesperson said.  Swift encouraged her supporters to register to vote and research early voting information.  “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday night. With margins expected to be tight in battleground states this November, Swift’s capacity to shake up the presidential race could make a difference.  Swift also urged fans to register to vote while accepting an award at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards on Wednesday. Vote.org doesn’t have post-VMA data at this point. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer continued on Thursday to tie former President Donald Trump to the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a conservative policy roadmap for a Republican presidential administration. Trump has said that he is unfamiliar with the project, which Schumer called, “an American nightmare. The most conservative, unhinged and extreme agenda we’ve seen in modern times.” He added, “Trump’s first term in office wouldn’t hold a candle to the ideas in Project 2025.” Schumer and several of his Senate Democratic colleagues pointed to parts of the proposal that are “laying the groundwork for a national abortion ban,” and note that it includes a plan to abolish the Department of Education. They also argued that the mortgage policies would “make it harder for Americans to own a home.”  “This is sinister stuff,” said Schumer. “The vast majority of Americans oppose them, yet it is precisely what the hard right is promising the American people if Donald Trump returns to office.” Pressed on Republicans’ insistence that Trump would not sign a national abortion ban —although Trump did not explicitly rule it out at Tuesday night’s presidential debate – the majority leader said, “look at everything he’s said over the years…No one believes him. Everybody knows what he’s going to do.” More about Project 2025: The 920-page document was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration. Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.”   Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism. A Harris campaign official previously said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.”  Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he believes former President Donald Trump’s across-the-board tariff proposals are part of a negotiation tactic and claimed that tariffs are “not always” inflationary.  “When people say these tariffs are going to have an effect, Donald Trump already imposed specific tariffs on specific industries. You didn’t see the negative consequences come to light. In fact, what you saw was rising wages and rising take home pay. So, when people say you can’t do this in a narrow way, you can’t do it in a broad-based way, I just think that doesn’t actually fit with reality,” Vance said.  Trump has said that if elected, he would impose tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports and 10% across-the-board tariff on imports from other nations. He also said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar. What experts say: Maury Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN that such high levies would raise prices on consumers, especially if they were applied widely — although he cautioned that it’s unclear under what conditions Trump would impose 100% tariffs. Christine McDaniel, a former senior trade official in the George W. Bush administration, called the idea “crazy” and “silly season campaign rhetoric.” Alex Durante, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, told CNN that 100% tariffs would threaten the economy. Attorney General Merrick Garland slammed efforts to turn the Justice Department into a “political weapon” during a fiery speech Thursday to department staff and US attorneys from across the country. Garland decried the “escalation of attacks” against career staff in years through “conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods, efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants by repeatedly and publicly singling them out, and threats of actual violence.” The attorney general’s comments come as former President Donald Trump has claimed that the Justice Department has been weaponized against him amid his criminal prosecutions and suggested that he would politicize the department should he return to the Oval Office. Neither Trump nor his allies were mentioned by name. But Trump and his associates have publicly discussed plans to dismantle the department and its law enforcement components like the FBI, or to prosecute his political enemies. “Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics,” Garland added to applause. Garland also thanked the prosecutors and Justice Department staff for refusing to “bend to politics” and “break under pressure.” Read more about Garland’s remarks. The Harris campaign is launching a new abortion-focused ad Thursday, capitalizing on what officials believe was one of the most pivotal exchanges between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump during Tuesday’s presidential debate. Harris’ team prepared the vice president to confront Trump on nationwide abortion restrictions. Her aides argue the preparation paid off, crediting her needling him on reproductive rights for throwing him off balance the rest of the debate. And now, they’re turning that moment into an ad that will run in battleground states, including in Arizona and Nevada where Trump heads this week. The newly released ad includes both candidates’ responses on abortion on the debate stage. “I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,” Trump said, referring to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Harris, in response, ran through personal stories of women struggling to get health care while navigating abortion restrictions. “I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body should not be made by the government,” she said. Continue reading about Harris’ new ad. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance defended former President Donald Trump’s debate performance, and he didn’t explicitly say if he believes there should be a second one.  It wasn’t clear which poll Vance was referencing. In a CNN flash poll, 63% of registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate say Vice President Kamala Harris outperformed Trump. Among the group, 31% described themselves as Democrats, 39% as Republicans and 30% as independents or members of another party.  Vance was asked if he had any frustration on what Trump was focusing on in the debate versus what he could have said about Harris.  Vance said he disagrees with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who said that Trump lost the debate.   “When you see how the undecided voters react, that’s what actually matters the most. But it’s telling that immediately after the debate, Kamala Harris came out and said, yes, I’d like to do another debate,” Vance said.  Vance has two fundraisers in New York City today, according to a source familiar. Springfield, Ohio’s City Hall was forced to close Thursday “due to a bomb threat that was issued to multiple facilities throughout Springfield today.” It’s unclear what the nature of the threat was; officials were alerted to the threat via email at 8:24 a.m, ET, according to the city. Springfield has been the center of false claim pushed by former President Donald Trump and others that Haitian migrants in the community are stealing and eating pets. City officials have told CNN they have seen no evidence of that happening. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced on Thursday a grant program that would support new farmers in Minnesota to buy equipment or improve infrastructure on their farm.  The new grant funding comes as Walz seeks to appeal to agriculture workers, farmers and rural voters while campaigning around the country as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.  Under the new program, beginner farmers would be allowed to apply for up to $20,000 grants to purchase farm equipment or improve infrastructure like irrigation systems or livestock buildings. The program expects to award $800,000 in total.  Harris’ running mate has often highlighted his rural upbringing in Nebraska and his connection to rural voters through his time representing rural Minnesotans in Congress and as governor. In an interview with WCMU, a public radio station in Michigan, Walz touted his connection to people in “ag districts” and spoke on how he hopes to win their support.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal warned his fellow Democrats not to get complacent after Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance — citing Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016.  “I’m deeply concerned that this race is going to be neck and neck right to the finish, and the euphoria that a lot of people are feeling right now, while justified, perhaps, after her tremendous performance in the debate, may lead to complacency or overconfidence,” he told CNN. Asked how Harris can protect herself against that trend, the Connecticut Democrat continued, “You avoid that trap by sounding the alarm and raising awareness about past complacency — we have only to look at Hillary Clinton to see how complacency and overconfidence can lead to disaster, especially after a good debate.”  Conservative activist Leonard Leo is threatening to withhold some of his $1 billion in funds from dozens of groups he supports unless they can demonstrate plans to “weaponize the conservative vision.” In a letter obtained by CNN, Leo makes it clear he wants groups that are supported by his 85 Fund to take concrete action to “crush liberal dominance” if they want to continue to receive funding.  The letter outlines how Leo believes left-wing activist groups have used their funds to “weaponize” their philosophy — and he would like to see groups that are supported by his 85 Fund do the same. Leo believes that conservative philanthropy needs to move “less in the direction of research, policy, and general education,” and instead use funding to “operationalize or weaponize the conservative vision.”  In his letter, Leo says the Left has taken this “enormous” step in operationalizing their ideas. Leo is known as one of the architects of Trump’s conservative Supreme Court. He helped Trump select Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Since taking the bench, the Trump’s appointees have been a part of several federal laws — including the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The letter cites groups like Students for Justice in Palestine, Voter Registration Project and World Professional Association for Transgender Health as a few organizations that have benefited from left-wing funding and are using the funds to mobilize their ideology.  The letter does not specifically name any groups that Leo is threatening to withhold funding from. He added that the review of his funds was provoked by, in his opinion, the amount of his funds being put towards “ideation.” This letter was first reported by Axios.  It’s easy to dismiss many presidential candidates’ campaign promises as empty, because Congress would need to approve them. Tariffs are different. Presidents have vast powers to lob tariffs on friends and foes, as former President Donald Trump demonstrated when he waged a trade war starting in 2018. That’s why some experts are alarmed and baffled by Trump’s latest threat to use his favorite economic weapon. During a rally in battleground Wisconsin last weekend, Trump vowed to impose staggering tariffs on countries that snub the US dollar. The US dollar remains the world’s reserve currency – essentially a super currency that helps international trade flow and the global economy to function. But Trump’s threat appears to be in response to China, Russia and other countries that have made noise about finding an alternative to the greenback. Taking a hardline on protecting the almighty dollar might sound good on the campaign trail, but experts warn that such a massive tariff would likely backfire on the American people. Read the full story. Taylor Swift’s call to encourage people to register to vote may be having an impact, according to the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency that provides government services. It was not immediately clear how many of those visitors registered to vote.  Vote.gov, which is the link Swift shared in her endorsement, is the federal government’s voting registration site run by the GSA. The website directs voters to their individual states and territories to register to vote and provides answers to frequently asked questions. Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post on Tuesday night. Vote.org also saw a huge spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement. A spokesperson for Vote.org told CNN there was a 585% jump in voters on the website between 9 p.m. through midnight ET, during the debate and shortly after Swift’s post endorsing the Harris-Walz campaign.  While voter engagement across the country likely increased also due to the debate, the CEO of Vote.org attributed the spike, in part, to the Taylor effect.  “Taylor Swift’s impact on voter engagement is undeniable,” Andrea Hailey, Vote.org CEO, said in a statement to CNN. New York’s highest court rejected two separate attempts to hear Donald Trump’s appeals on the gag order in his hush money case, according to a decision list posted Thursday. The gag order, issued by Judge Juan Merchan in the criminal case against Trump, remains in effect, although Merchan lifted portions of it in June. Trump’s attorneys had challenged both the initial gag order and the modified gag order. The judges wrote that they declined to hear the case about the modified gag order because “no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.” Trump’s legal team had no immediate comment. Trump was found guilty earlier this year of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sentencing in the case has been delayed until late November. This is one of four criminal cases Trump faces while running again for president. A nearly four-year-old legal effort by Black voters to convince a court to prevent former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party from potentially intimidating voters and poll workers is quietly coming back to life as the 2024 election approaches. First brought in the days following the 2020 election, the lawsuit has moved slowly through the federal courts in Washington, DC, as Trump’s claims of presidential immunity from civil lawsuits were being litigated. It coincidently has landed before US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge handling the federal election subversion charges against Trump. But now, the case is beginning to show signs of movement. The case could have enormous implications for this election and future ones: The voters are asking a federal judge to put Trump, his campaign and the Republican National Committee under court supervision that would require them to seek pre-approval before “engaging in any activities related to recounts, certifications, or similar post-election activities,” and to bar the defendants from intimidating voters, poll workers and other election officials. If the plaintiffs ultimately prevail, their victory could provide them with a significant deterrence against potential intimidation and harassment of election workers and voters from Republicans as Trump and his allies signal that they will again try to undermine the results of the election. Read the full story. The Trump campaign is up with a new ad in Pennsylvania warning voters that Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking, despite Kamala Harris’ recent statements to the contrary, seizing on a key issue in the battleground state. “Harris will ban all fracking,” the ad opens, over images of Harris’ high-profile interview with CNN earlier this month, her first sit-down as the new Democratic nominee. The ad proceeds to play a clip of Harris at a CNN Town Hall in 2019, taking a question from a voter. “That will immediately put tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians out of work and send utility bills skyrocketing,” the ad’s narrator says. “Trump will protect clean energy fracking and protect the jobs it creates.”  Harris was asked directly about her position on fracking at Tuesday’s debate, and she answered, “I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.” The new ad from the Trump campaign reflects the salience of the issue. Fracking is a major industry in Pennsylvania, the top battleground state this election cycle, drawing more campaign dollars than any other. And the debate over the industry’s economic and environmental impacts is one of several shaping the fierce contest in the commonwealth. This comes as the Harris campaign on Wednesday released its first digital ad following the presidential debate featuring clips from her performance as it seeks to highlight the contrast with Trump. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who served under Republican George W. Bush, told CNN News Central that he’s backing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris because he believes she is “most likely to be dedicated to trying to unite America. I don’t see that, that discipline, that willingness in Donald Trump.” Gonzales said he felt the need to come out publicly against Trump “because of his lack of, as we see it, his lack of support, lack of willingness to abide by the rule of law,” adding that he believes Harris has “demonstrated fidelity to the rule of law.” “I thought her performance during the convention was good. I thought her performance during the debate was outstanding, quite frankly,” he said. Gonzalez first announced his support for Harris earlier this morning in a Politico op-ed. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell – who warned about Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016 – said she was “ecstatic” about Tuesday’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump until she had a conversation with a local official back home.   “I was ecstatic like every other Democrat as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin,” she told Kasie Hunt of Harris on CNN This Morning.  The Michigan Democrat warned that polls showing Harris leading Trump in her home state, a key battleground, may not be accurate. “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” Dingell explained.  Election Day is less than two months away, and both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have a busy schedule of campaign events today following their presidential debate. CNN poll of debate watchers found that registered voters who watched the presidential debate broadly agreed Harris outperformed Trump. Despite many saying that Harris won the showdown, the vice president still faces a tight race. Read fact checks and key takeaways from the night. Trump said he is still weighing whether to debate Harris again, while the Harris campaign said it is entering a more aggressive phase as it seeks to build on momentum following the presidential debate and mobilize voters in key battleground states.  Here’s more on the campaign: The Harris campaign on Wednesday released its first digital ad following the presidential debate featuring clips from her performance as it seeks to highlight the contrast with Donald Trump. The ad, titled “Leadership,” aims to emphasize Harris’ message to “chart a new way forward,” and spotlights her commitment to bring “a sense of optimism about what we can do,” according to a news release from the campaign. The 30-second slot shows Trump on the debate stage in what the Harris campaign referred to as “thrashing” the country. “We’re a failing nation. A nation that is dying. We’re a nation that’s in serious decline,” Trump said. “What I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do. We all have so much more in common than what separates us. And we can chart a new way forward,” Harris said.  The ad will air across digital platforms and is part of the Harris campaign’s $370 million investment in digital and television reservations between Labor Day and Election Day. Ex-President Donald Trump is equivocating over the possibility of a second debate with Kamala Harris after his dud display in their first showdown prompted his team and conservative media allies to mount a frantic cleanup operation. It’s far too early to say whether the tangle in Philadelphia substantially changed the race as Harris beseeches remaining movable voters in swing states to ditch the chaos of the Trump era. But in the aftermath of Tuesday’s debate, both campaigns are surveying the impact of a critical clash before more than 60 million viewers eight weeks from Election Day. Trump, who took multiple victory laps following President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, found himself facing the kind of inquest endured by his erstwhile rival. While the ex-president’s campaign will not suffer the same fate as Biden’s shuttered reelection effort, the debate was the latest sign that Trump is still failing to focus on the new challenges posed by Harris and make his own best case. The vice president was basking in a fresh jolt of euphoria among Democrats who perceive an oft-doubted political figure growing in stature with every test she passes. Harris’ campaign is also leveraging the endorsement of Taylor Swift, which could open a new seam of interest among the pop megastar’s loyal fanbase. And her allies are reinforcing the tone of mockery and attempts to goad Trump that emerged at the Democratic National Convention and that the vice president carried into the debate. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played Trump in Harris’ debate prep, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the ex-president has slowed mentally since 2016 and compared him to a “malfunctioning appliance.” Read Collinson’s full analysis. The Harris campaign says it is entering a more aggressive phase as it seeks to build on momentum following the presidential debate and mobilize voters in key battleground states.  Today, Vice President Kamala Harris will kick off her “New Way Forward” tour through swing states, beginning with two rallies in Charlotte and Greensboro, North Carolina. On Friday, Harris will hold events in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a state she has reiterated she needs to win in November. The campaign is expected to launch new TV and digital ads featuring key moments from the debate. The day after Harris’ performance, staffers spent hours poring through debate footage to identify key moments to highlight key issues among voters while offering a stark contrast between Trump. The campaign released its first digital ad yesterday featuring clips from her performance. The ad, titled “Leadership,” aims to emphasize Harris’ message to “chart a new way forward” and spotlights her commitment to bring “a sense of optimism about what we can do,” according to a press release from the campaign. More media dates: The vice president is expected to hold more media engagements in the coming days, including in local markets through swing states. It comes as she has faced mounting criticism for not holding more interviews. Next week, she will also participate in a discussion with journalists at the National Association of Black Journalists. Harris was unable to attend NABJ’s annual convention due to a prior obligation and opted to reschedule her speaking engagement. Top Harris surrogates will also have a robust schedule on the trail, with less than two months until Election Day. Today and tomorrow, Gov. Tim Walz will campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, while Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff attends events in Arizona and Nevada. Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz will travel to Manchester, New Hampshire, and Maine to campaign, including headlining an Educators for Harris-Walz event and visiting a phone bank. The “New Way Forward” tour is also set to include surrogate events to target key voter groups today. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are back on the campaign trail today as they make their pitch to voters with less than two months until Election Day. Harris is heading to North Carolina and will attend two campaign rallies in Charlotte and Greensboro as she kicks off her “New Way Forward” tour through swing states. Trump is heading to Arizona, where he will deliver remarks in Tucson. The former president is also scheduled to attend a fundraising event in Los Angeles, California. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will travel to Michigan to hold a campaign event in Grand Rapids. As soon as Donald Trump exited the debate stage in Philadelphia Tuesday night, he immediately began quizzing those waiting in his viewing room about how the last 90 minutes had gone. While several praised him to his face, telling him he did a “great job,” that’s not what many of them are saying privately.  Instead, those around Trump have described what happened on stage as a draw at best and a loss at worst. Several of them told CNN they were stunned that the former president failed to do a better job executing on the talking points he had prepared against Vice President Harris, her record and her policy reversals.  Trump had done more debate prep ahead of his first meeting with Harris than he did for his debate with President Joe Biden earlier this summer, two people told CNN. Yet Trump didn’t make one of his central arguments against Harris — about why she hasn’t carried out the promises she’s making now in the last 3.5 years in office — until his closing argument, surprising many of them who have heard him make the argument in private and on the campaign trail.  Instead, one person conceded, Trump took the bait every single time Harris offered it. While multiple Trump allies described what happened Tuesday night as a “missed opportunity,” they have since started downplaying the debate’s overall significance, arguing it won’t shift his numbers with voters in states like Pennsylvania.  Trump himself was noncommittal about a second debate Wednesday morning, though almost every ally of his who CNN spoke with said they believe he will ultimately agree to one.  Voters and lawmakers are reacting to the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as the countdown to Election Day continues in a very tight race. The two candidates came face-to-face for a second time this week at an event commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks yesterday. Here are the latest developments in the race: The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks, according to Nielsen data. Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia, hosted by ABC News, was aired across 17 television networks and easily surpassed the 51 million who tuned in to the June debate hosted by CNN between Trump and President Joe Biden.  While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year, it represents a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016, a record 84 million tuned in to the first debate matchup between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Viewership habits have changed dramatically since 2016, and Nielsen does not account for the myriad streaming and social media platforms that many also used to watch Tuesday’s debate. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. ABC drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million and Fox News with more than 9 million. Former President Donald Trump said his team is still weighing whether he would engage in another debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, after her team immediately called for a second debate in October.  “I would do NBC. I would do FOX too, but right now, we have to determine whether or not we even want to do,” Trump said, after visiting the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department in Pennsylvania. “When you don’t win, it’s like a fighter — when a fighter has a bad fight gets knocked out or loses the fight, the first thing he says is we want a rematch. So, we won the debate according to every single poll, every single poll. Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” Trump said. “But we’ll think about it.” CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. As CNN reported this morning, a top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance. Trump said it was “very polite” between him and Harris Wednesday morning, who shook hands at the 9/11 commemoration ceremony. “Just, uh, very polite, very polite,” Trump said, when asked what he said to Harris."
Cristiano Ronaldo urges Manchester United to ‘rebuild everything’ as the club looks to rediscover past success | CNN,"Published 7:00 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T11:00:59.082Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/sport/cristiano-ronaldo-manchester-united-rebuild-spt-intl/index.html,"If Manchester United is broken, then Cristiano Ronaldo thinks that he has the keys to fix it. The Portuguese forward, who had two spells at United before leaving for the final time two years ago, has said that the club must “rebuild everything” in order to return to its past glories. Speaking on the “Rio Ferdinand Presents” podcast, Ronaldo told his former teammate that the mentality of the coaches and manager Erik ten Hag is holding back the current team. “The coaches, they say they cannot compete to win the league and the Champions League,” he said. “If you’re a Manchester United coach, you cannot say that, that you’re not going to fight to win the league or the Champions League. You have to mentally say, listen, maybe we don’t have that potential … but we’re going to try, you have to try.” United won the most recent of its 13 Premier League titles under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013, but the club has struggled under a string of different managers since then. With Dutchman ten Hag in charge, United finished eighth in the league last season, its worst Premier League finish in history, but did defeat rival Manchester City to win the FA Cup in May. The beginning of this season has been underwhelming, with a 1-0 victory against Fulham followed by defeats against Brighton and Liverpool. “This club needs time to rebuild,” said Ronaldo. “It is still one of the best clubs in the world, but they need to change. They understand that it’s the only way. “I believe that the future will be bright, but they [can’t] depend only on the talents, it’s more than that,” he added. “It’s all the club, not only players, everything as a unit, united. “They have to rebuild from the bottom; if not, they cannot compete, it will be impossible. They can do good things. Yes, they can win Carabao (Cup) … but the Champions League or Europa League or Premier League (will be) difficult, in my opinion. I wish that I’m wrong, but it will be difficult.” The 39-year-old departed United in acrimonious fashion in 2022 having given an explosive interview with Piers Morgan for TalkTV, explaining how he felt betrayed by the club. He also said that he had no respect for ten Hag. Ronaldo was largely used as a substitute by the manager and refused to go onto the pitch against Tottenham Hotspur during his final weeks with the Red Devils, instead walking down the tunnel with minutes of the match still remaining. Now playing for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo said that he still loves United and wants to see the club succeed. He told Ferdinand that the recent addition of former striker Ruud van Nistelrooy to the coaching staff will “help a lot.” The Dutchman spent five years at United, scoring 150 goals in 219 appearances. “You cannot rebuild a club without knowledge,” said Ronaldo. “Not guys who work in offices, (who say), ‘I understand a lot of football because I see football on the television every day.’ It doesn’t work like that. “The people who understand football 99% is the people who were there, in the dressing room, who were players.” Ronaldo scored the 900th goal of his career while playing for Portugal against Croatia last week, then also netted against Scotland several days later. He scored 145 goals while playing for United, transforming himself from a talented winger to a prolific goalscorer during his first stint at the club, before making the then biggest transfer in football history to Real Madrid."
Trump likely wouldn’t need Congress to approve his most controversial trade policy | CNN Business,"Updated 6:26 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T08:30:19.588Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/business/trump-economy-tariffs-dollar/index.html,"It’s easy to dismiss many presidential candidates’ campaign promises as empty, because Congress would need to approve them. Tariffs are different. Presidents have vast powers to lob tariffs on friends and foes, as former President Donald Trump demonstrated when he waged a trade war starting in 2018. That’s why some experts are alarmed and baffled by Trump’s latest threat to use his favorite economic weapon. During a rally in battleground Wisconsin last weekend, Trump vowed to impose staggering tariffs on countries that snub the US dollar. “Many countries are leaving the dollar. They are not going to leave the dollar with me,” Trump said. “I’ll say, ‘You leave the dollar, you’re not doing business with the United States because we’re going to put a 100% tariff on your goods.” The US dollar remains the world’s reserve currency – essentially a super currency that helps international trade flow and the global economy to function. But Trump’s threat appears to be in response to China, Russia and other countries that have made noise about finding an alternative to the greenback. Taking a hardline on protecting the almighty dollar might sound good on the campaign trail, but experts warn that such a massive tariff would likely backfire on the American people. “I would characterize this as incoherent, tough-guy posturing,” Maury Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN in a phone interview. Obstfeld, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), noted that while some countries have diversified away from the US dollar, the greenback remains the world’s preeminent currency. Although he cautioned that it’s unclear under what conditions Trump would impose 100% tariffs, Obstfeld said such high levies would raise prices on consumers – especially if they were applied widely. “100% tariffs would have a pretty severe effect on the price of goods we import from those countries and therefore inflation,” Obstfeld said. Christine McDaniel, a former senior trade official in the George W. Bush administration, called Trump’s 100% tariff idea “crazy” and “silly season campaign rhetoric.” “Trump’s answer to just about anything is tariffs,” said McDaniel, now a senior research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. McDaniel told CNN that Trump can likely apply tariffs he’s proposing unilaterally without approval from Congress following a report from the United States Trade Representative (USTR) under Section 301 or a report from the Commerce Department under Section 232. She cautioned that it is possible Congress could amend current law to claw back that trade authority. Alex Durante, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, told CNN that 100% tariffs would threaten the economy. “When you’re﻿ talking about tariffs this high, that will almost certainly increase the risk of a recession. Consumers only have so much to spend,” Durante said. Of course, it’s impossible to know how serious Trump is about this proposal. It’s possible he is floating 100% tariffs as just a threat designed to change the behavior of other countries. Brian Hughes, senior adviser to the Trump campaign, told CNN in a statement that Trump’s policies will “fuel growth, drive down inflation, inspire American manufacturing” and protect workers from “lopsided policies tilted in favor of other countries.” “Time warp alert! Just like in 2016, Wall Street forecasts said that Trump policies would result in lower growth and higher inflation, the media took these forecasts at face value, and the record was never corrected when actual growth and job gains widely outperformed these opinions,” Hughes said. The Trump campaign did not provide an explanation to CNN about how Trump would implement 100% tariffs nor what the trigger would be. A Harris campaign spokesperson declined to comment on whether Vice President Kamala Harris supports or opposes such tariffs. Trump has repeatedly insisted that his trade agenda would not invite inflation – even though study after study has found that American consumers and industries bear almost the entire cost of US tariffs, including the ones imposed by Trump. And while economists may debate how much his proposed tariffs would raise prices, many agree they would be inflationary. Even some at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, the elite business school Trump received his undergraduate degree from, don’t doubt that. “If we actually did have these tariffs, then there is no question prices would go up. The bigger question is how big other countries would respond with their own tariffs,” Kent Smetters, faculty director of the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CNN in a phone interview on Wednesday. “There is no question it’s inflationary,” said Smetters, who is a business economics and public policy professor at Wharton. He added that some estimates may overstate the impact of tariffs because tariffed-goods can sometimes be substituted for domestic goods. During Tuesday night’s ABC debate, Trump said that many of the “top professors” at Wharton “think my plan is a brilliant plan, it’s a great plan.” Wharton did not respond to CNN requests for members of its faculty who support Trump’s plan. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, described Trump’s threat of a 100% tariff as “radical” and a “profoundly bad set of ideas.” “I’m not certain what Mr. Trump is talking about and, the truth is, I don’t think he knows either,” said Brusuelas, echoing a line Trump used about President Joe Biden in his July debate with the then-presumptive Democratic nominee before Biden dropped out of the race. Brusuelas cautioned that while a candidate can get away with making radical threats, a president must deal with global financial markets. He said Trump’s tariff plan, if enacted, would risk setting off a market panic like former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss did in 2022. Her misjudged tax proposals made her deeply unpopular, and she quickly resigned, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. “If they ever tried this, they would see a swift and violent reaction from the US bond market. It would engineer a Liz Truss-type moment where global investors express a loss of confidence,” said Brusuelas. Still, some business groups are bracing for a return of “Tariff Man,” a nickname Trump gave himself. “We have to take the former president very seriously. He has a track record,” said Matt Priest, the president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, an industry trade group. “We are spending a lot of time coaching our members about how to prepare for the impact of these proposals.” The ironic thing about Trump’s 100% tariff idea is that some experts worry threats like this could encourage countries to find an alternative to the dollar – the exact opposite of Trump’s stated aim. “The kind of rhetoric Trump is throwing around is the fastest route to get countries to stop using the dollar,” said Obstfeld, the former IMF economist."
Trump is drowning in the misinformation swamp he helped create | CNN Business,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T10:00:22.980Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/business/trump-misinformation-social-media-moderation/index.html,"The Republican nominee for president went on live TV and presented an unhinged, debunked Facebook rumor as fact. When corrected (several times) by a moderator, Donald Trump doubled down: “The people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.” “They’re eating the dogs,” quickly became a punchline among commentators who understand that the whole story about Haitian immigrants eating people’s pets in Ohio was a lie, rooted in a well-established racist history. It’s the kind of outrage-bait that, while disgusting, is hardly unexpected on Facebook these days. But the claim’s elevation to the presidential debate stage underscores a grim reality about the internet in 2024: Misinformation is everywhere, platforms are giving up on moderation and AI is making it all worse. Trump’s debate performance “was like a 4chan post come to life,” said CNN’s Jake Tapper. It’s an apt analogy. 4chan, once an innocuous online message board for anime enthusiasts in the early 2000s, is a prime example of what happens when you remove the guardrails from a social media site, with only a handful of community members regulating it. Over the years, 4chan has become a cesspool of violence, conspiracy theories and its own particular brand of “edgelord white supremacy,” as the Verge put it. Scrolling on Facebook or X, it’s hard not to see some of that chaos creeping into the mainstream. As my colleague Clare Duffy wrote last week, Facebook spam is surging, and, in extreme cases, it is being weaponized to scam and mislead people — a shift that coincides with an intentional strategy by the platform to downplay news and politics while amplifying vapid, computer-generated content into users’ feeds. Over on X, which Elon Musk acquired in 2022 and promptly gutted its moderation efforts, hate speech and violent threats are now fair game. A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said last week that it works “to remove and reduce the spread of spammy content to ensure a positive user experience” and “take action against those who attempt to manipulate traffic through inauthentic engagement.” Musk, who fired Twitter’s communications staff when he took over the platform, didn’t respond to a request for comment. To be sure, there’s always been gross and fake stuff on social media. The difference now is how quickly it morphs into misinformation, often fueled by human-like AI text and images, with fewer staff dedicated to monitoring and taking down fake information. Once upon a time, you had to go through a process, overseen by human moderators, to get a “verified” check mark on Twitter; now, anyone with or without an agenda to push can simply buy it. In some ways, Trump’s political career tracks the rise and deterioration of social media over the past decade. The former reality star made his name in politics in part by exploiting social media’s power to broadcast lies and conspiracy theories to the masses, starting with his racist “birther” attacks on President Barack Obama. With Tuesday night’s foray into the pet-eating lie, he may have finally veered so deep into the internet muck he can’t see through it. Just a few weeks ago, the former president posted an AI-generated image on his Truth Social platform that suggested Taylor Swift had endorsed him. “I accept,” he wrote in the post. Of course, it was a fake image — the same kind of obvious AI slop that has overrun Facebook and X. Either Trump didn’t know the image was fake, or he didn’t mind lying to his followers and perpetuating the fake endorsement. Neither scenario suggests he’s too concerned about the problem of misinformation online. Taylor Swift, for her part, is concerned. In endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday, Swift wrote that the incident with the fake images of her “conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.” She signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady” — a nod to widely ridiculed comments from Trump’s running mate, JD Vance. As if on cue, Musk, the pro-Trump multibillionaire who also shared the fake pet-eating story on X this week, chimed in to remind everyone that you can say whatever you want on his platform, no matter how vile or threatening to a woman who’s never publicly acknowledged him. “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.”"
The ‘sleeper case’ trying to stop Trump and the RNC from intimidating voters and poll workers | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T09:00:21.333Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/sleeper-case-rnc-trump-voter-intimidation/index.html,"A nearly four-year-old legal effort by Black voters to convince a court to prevent former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party from potentially intimidating voters and poll workers is quietly coming back to life as the 2024 election approaches. First brought in the days following the 2020 election, the lawsuit has moved slowly through the federal courts in Washington, DC, as Trump’s claims of presidential immunity from civil lawsuits were being litigated. It coincidently has landed before US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge handling the federal election subversion charges against Trump. But now, the case is beginning to show signs of movement. The case could have enormous implications for this election and future ones: The voters are asking a federal judge to put Trump, his campaign and the Republican National Committee under court supervision that would require them to seek pre-approval before “engaging in any activities related to recounts, certifications, or similar post-election activities,” and to bar the defendants from intimidating voters, poll workers and other election officials. If the plaintiffs ultimately prevail, their victory could provide them with a significant deterrence against potential intimidation and harassment of election workers and voters from Republicans as Trump and his allies signal that they will again try to undermine the results of the election. The type of supervision sought by the voters is not new for the Republican Party: The GOP had previously been under a court-ordered consent decree from the early 1980s until 2017 that barred it from engaging in practices that could intimidate or discriminate against Black voters. Rajiv Parikh, an attorney who represented the Democratic Party during part of the long-running case against the RNC that resulted in the now-expired consent decree, said courts play a critical role in preventing the type of intimidation that the Black voters are alleging occurred during the 2020 election. “Just because your intention isn’t to discriminate against a group or to intimidate somebody, if what you do has the effect of doing that, then it really is going to be up to a court as an independent arbiter of what’s appropriate or what’s not to decide that,” he said. At the heart of the lawsuit are claims by Black voters in Michigan that the defendants worked together in 2020 to unlawfully disenfranchise them and other voters in “major metropolitan areas with large Black voter populations” through “disrupting vote counting efforts, lodging groundless challenges during recounts, and attempting to block certification of election results through intimidation and coercion of election officials and volunteers.” In doing so, the lawsuit alleges, the defendants violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act, a Reconstruction-era law passed to combat violence by the White supremacist group and allow people to take civil action against individuals who “conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat,” participation in US elections. Attorneys for Trump and the RNC have asked to dismiss the case, saying any conduct at issue constitutes protected political speech. “This is simply a transparent attempt to quell political dissent and chill political speech,” a lawyer for Trump and his campaign wrote in a filing last year. “Even assuming all the allegations are true, President Trump and his Campaign engaged in simple and straightforward political speech during an important political dispute.” Chutkan has yet to make any substantial rulings in the matter. She was randomly assigned the pivotal case last October, receiving it months after she started overseeing the criminal case brought by special counsel Jack Smith against Trump. Weeks later, the judge stressed the need to have “some forward motion” in the civil matter as the nation barreled toward the presidential election. “It’s been pending for a long time. At a certain point, a failure to decide means that it effectively denies the plaintiffs their remedy,” Chutkan said during a hearing in late November. The lawsuit, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization v. Trump, is asking both for court supervision of election-related activities as well as monetary damages for the alleged harms that took place around the 2020 election. But in recent weeks, the plaintiffs asked for permission to drop their demand for damages to avoid a protracted fight over whether Trump can avoid liability by arguing that his actions during the last election are shielded by presidential immunity. In a filing Tuesday, lawyers for the Black voters stressed that avoiding litigation over the question of immunity would allow the case to “proceed expeditiously … particularly in light of the upcoming November election.” The now-expired consent decree the RNC had been under for nearly four decades was between Republicans and the Democratic National Committee, which had sued the GOP over alleged intimidation of voters in majority Black areas of New Jersey during the 1981 election. The proposed supervision in the DC case would differ from the earlier consent decree in several key ways. First, it would be between the GOP and nonpartisan voters instead of two political parties. Second, the earlier consent decree was primarily concerned with poll watching, whereas the proposed one seeks to protect both voters and election workers, a group of officials who were targeted by Trump’s allies in 2020 as he pushed lies about the legitimacy of the election and its results. “In this fraught and dangerous climate, twenty percent of election officials polled plan to leave before the 2024 election, in large part due to political leaders’ attacks. Thirty percent of officials know of one or more election workers who already have left their jobs because of fear for their safety, increased threats, or intimidation,” the lawsuit states. Parikh said he sees the court supervision sought as being especially important in swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, where Republican lawyers might focus their efforts on areas in those states with large populations of minority voters. The Ku Klux Klan Act has not been well litigated in the modern era, according to legal experts, though in recent years some plaintiffs have leaned on the statute as they’ve sought to hold Trump and his supporters accountable for their actions around the 2020 election, or pursue monetary damages from individuals who have engaged in right-wing political violence. Ruth Greenwood, the director of the Election Law Clinic at Harvard Law School, said that the notable thing about the DC case is that “it is seeking to use the KKK Act a lot more for its original purposes.” The Black voters, Greenwood said, are trying to “ensure that there is a court that litigants can rush to if these types of actions are tried again in 2024.” Cases pending in DC that invoke other provisions of the 1871 law have been brought by Democratic lawmakers and Capitol Police officers against Trump and his allies in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Another high-profile use of the law was in a case over conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman’s voter suppression campaign that used robocalls to target Black voters during the 2020 election. A federal judge found the two men liable for targeting Black voters in 2023, saying that their actions ran afoul of the KKK Act, the VRA and other laws. The two later agreed to pay $1 million for the scheme. One of the most notable outcomes of the modern application of the law came in a federal courtroom in Charlottesville, Virginia. A jury fined neo-Nazi and White supremacist organizers and protesters in the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally millions for the distress they gave counterprotesters, including four who were struck by a car. An appeals court later limited the damages for the plaintiffs to about $2 million. Meanwhile, a jury this week is hearing a case in Austin’s federal court where Biden-Harris campaign affiliates in 2020 say they were traumatized by drivers in a “Trump Train” caravan that surrounded their campaign bus on a Texas interstate. The judge overseeing that matter has signed off on the KKK Act being used in the case."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. The Harris campaign on Wednesday released its first digital ad following the presidential debate featuring clips from her performance as it seeks to highlight the contrast with Donald Trump. The ad, titled “Leadership,” aims to emphasize Harris’ message to “chart a new way forward,” and spotlights her commitment to bring “a sense of optimism about what we can do,” according to a news release from the campaign. The 30-second slot shows Trump on the debate stage in what the Harris campaign referred to as “thrashing” the country. “We’re a failing nation. A nation that is dying. We’re a nation that’s in serious decline,” Trump said. “What I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do. We all have so much more in common than what separates us. And we can chart a new way forward,” Harris said.  The ad will air across digital platforms and is part of the Harris campaign’s $370 million investment in digital and television reservations between Labor Day and Election Day. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played the role of former President Donald Trump in Kamala Harris’ debate preparations, celebrated the vice president’s performance at Tuesday’s debate while reflecting on how Trump has changed since his first presidential run eight years ago. Reines told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday that Harris was successful in carving out the space to remind viewers of Trump’s record while sharing her own plans for the next four years. Reines, who also played Trump in Hillary Clinton’s debate preparations in 2016, argued that that Trump’s messaging is now “all over the board” and described him as a “malfunctioning appliance.” Reines also gave insight that Harris initiating a handshake with Trump was “not a matter of rehearsal.” Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine weighed in on the false claims promoted by the Trump campaign that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Asked about the false claims during an interview with CBS on Wednesday DeWine said: “This is something that came up on the internet, and the internet can be quite crazy sometimes.” Former President Donald Trump repeated the false claim during Tuesday’s debate that had been amplified this week by right-wing media figures and echoed by Republican leaders.   “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,” Trump said. “The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country and it’s a shame.”  In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said: “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” As soon as Donald Trump exited the debate stage in Philadelphia Tuesday night, he immediately began quizzing those waiting in his viewing room about how the last 90 minutes had gone. While several praised him to his face, telling him he did a “great job,” that’s not what many of them are saying privately.  Instead, those around Trump have described what happened on stage as a draw at best and a loss at worst. Several of them told CNN they were stunned that the former president failed to do a better job executing on the talking points he had prepared against Vice President Harris, her record and her policy reversals.  Trump had done more debate prep ahead of his first meeting with Harris than he did for his debate with President Biden earlier this summer, two people told CNN. Yet Trump didn’t make one of his central arguments against Harris — about why she hasn’t carried out the promises she’s making now in the last 3.5 years in office — until his closing argument, surprising many of them who have heard him make the argument in private and on the campaign trail.  Instead, one person conceded, Trump took the bait every single time Harris offered it. While multiple Trump allies described what happened Tuesday night as a “missed opportunity,” they have since started downplaying the debate’s overall significance, arguing it won’t shift his numbers with voters in states like Pennsylvania.  Trump himself was noncommittal about a second debate Wednesday morning, though almost every ally of his who CNN spoke with said they believe he will ultimately agree to one.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged in a Fox News interview Wednesday that while he believed former President Donald Trump won the debate, Harris “clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization and her preparation.”  Kennedy predicted the debate may cost Trump support in upcoming polls.  “I think on substance, President Trump wins in terms of his governance,” Kennedy said. “But he didn’t tell that story.” Kennedy, who dropped out of the presidential race last month and endorsed Trump, highlighted the exchange on economic policy as “an extraordinary lost opportunity” by the Republican nominee, arguing Trump should have emphasized more strongly the consequences of rising inflation but instead became “distracted.”  Kennedy predicted Trump will see a dip in support in post-debate polling, particularly among independent voters. He also undercut Trump’s claim that rapid reaction polls on the debate universally show he won the debate.  “Polling over the next week is going to show, you know, probably a slight drop in his support, particularly among independents,” he continued.  When asked if he had any reservations about endorsing Trump, Kennedy said he still believes Trump is the better candidate on policy.  “I was listening to the substance, and on the substance, President Trump wins,” he said. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday she was “proud” of Kamala Harris’ debate performance and hit back at Donald Trump, who name-checked her during Tuesday night’s debate over the January 6, 2021, insurrection. “I was so proud of her,” Pelosi said of Harris, adding that Trump “looked foolish last night. I thought [Harris] looked presidential.” Trump, during the debate, incorrectly claimed that then-Speaker Pelosi was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and that she rejected his call to send in the National Guard. Pelosi pointed out Wednesday that the speaker of the House has no authority over the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president. She added that she pleaded with then-President Trump to send in the National Guard “and he never did, until finally he did hours later.” “We’re dependent on the president who has incited the insurrection and refused to send the National Guard,” she said, adding, “You know what? We don’t agonize, we organize. We just us have to win, we have to win big.” Voters and lawmakers are reacting to the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as the countdown to Election Day continues in a very tight race. The two candidates came face-to-face for a second time this week at an event commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks Wednesday morning. Here are the key headlines to know: Several House Republicans defended former President Donald Trump’s performance in last night’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, insisting that he was able to communicate his views on the economy, despite moving away from the issues at times. Conservative Rep. Ralph Norman accused the debate of being biased and told CNN’s Manu Raju that Harris did not have to meet high expectations. Norman also baselessly suggested that Harris possibly knew the questions that the moderators would ask ahead of time, but was unable to offer any evidence to back this up. “I think she knew the questions. I think she had her lines rehearsed, but the American people, whatever she says, they’re feeling it at the pump. They’re feeling it, you know, with crime, the policies haven’t worked, she’s been a part of it,” he said. Rep. Anthony D’Esposito a vulnerable New York Republican, praised Trump’s performance and said the former president “did a good job of talking about the issues that matter most to the American people, while Kamala Harris continued to pivot back and forth and spin what it is that she’s trying to portray now.” On the issue of abortion, Rep. John Duarte of California, another vulnerable Republican, argued that Trump “was clear that he wants abortion to be kept in the states,” and didn’t need to explicitly say he is against a national ban. Duarte also said that Trump, “did a great job communicating the economy, communicating inflation being so low under his presidency” and dismissed concerns that Trump focused too much on his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. “I don’t think that’s what voters are voting on. Voters are voting on inflation and opportunity right now, and right now, the American people are seeing out-of-control inflation and their opportunities are falling apart in the job market,” Duarte said. The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks, according to Nielsen data. Tuesday debate in Philadelphia hosted by ABC News and aired across 17 television networks easily surpassed the 51 million who tuned in to the June debate hosted by CNN between Trump and President Joe Biden.  While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year, it represents a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016, a record 84 million tuned in to the first debate matchup between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Viewership habits have changed dramatically since 2016, and Nielsen does not account for the myriad streaming and social media platforms that many also used to watch Tuesday’s debate. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. ABC drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million and Fox News with more than 9 million. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to attend his first campaign event as a Trump surrogate since endorsing the former president last month, according to a news release from the Donald Trump-JD Vance campaign. Kennedy will appear with former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard in a moderated discussion at a “Team Trump Reclaim America Tour” event in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday. The White House is offering an explanation of a photo circulating that shows President Joe Biden wearing a Trump hat at the firehouse in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, earlier Wednesday. Inside the fire station, Biden briefly donned a Trump hat as an apparent gesture of bipartisan unity. A White House spokesperson said the president was talking about how the country was united in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks and said it needed to return to that. He handed a hat to a man wearing a Trump cap as a gesture, and that man gave Biden his hat to briefly wear, the spokesperson said. Pictures show Biden smiling widely while wearing the hat. Joan London knew when Tuesday’s debate began she would not vote for Donald Trump. But when it ended, she was in a most unfamiliar place: ready to cast her first vote for a Democrat for president. In battleground Pennsylvania, by the way. “Harris clearly won,” said London, an attorney who lives in conservative Berks County. “And I’m now voting for her even though I have many serious policy differences.” London became a Republican when she turned 18, a fan of Ronald Reagan’s brand of conservatism. Earlier this year, she cast a primary vote for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, then switched her registration to independent because she sees Trump as an angry populist. Until this week’s debate in Philadelphia, though, she planned to honor her conservative principles and write in some other Republican. But everything changed when the former president repeatedly refused to say he believed it was critical that the United States stand with Ukraine. Trump said he wanted to end the war, and suggested he could negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine. Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, gave Harris more positive reviews for her debate performance. Several though, significantly, said she was not specific enough in explaining her policy proposals. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, a Haley primary voter who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues. Cynthia Sabatini, a Reagan Republican and “never Trump” voter, plans to write in a conservative or vote third party unless Harris wins her over. The vice president did not do so Tuesday night. “She is a good debater,” Sabatini said. “But in my opinion, she needs to answer questions on point.” Specifically, Sabatini said Harris failed out of the gate when asked whether she believed Americans are better off than they were four years ago and again on questions about the border. Read more about what voters had to say about the debate. Taylor Swift’s call to encourage people to register to vote may be having an impact, according to the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency that provides government services. It was not immediately clear how many of those visitors registered to vote.  Vote.gov, which is the link Swift shared in her endorsement, is the federal government’s voting registration site run by the GSA. The website directs voters to their individual states and territories to register to vote and provides answers to frequently asked questions. Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post on Tuesday night, Vote.org also saw a huge spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement. A spokesperson for Vote.org told CNN there was a 585% jump in voters on the website between 9 p.m. through midnight ET, during the debate and shortly after Swift’s post endorsing the Harris-Walz campaign.  While voter engagement across the country likely increased also due to the debate, the CEO of Vote.org attributed the spike, in part, to the Taylor effect.  “Taylor Swift’s impact on voter engagement is undeniable,” Andrea Hailey, Vote.org CEO, said in a statement to CNN. The post was updated with more details on the reaction from Vote.org Democratic Sen. Chris Coons praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance in last night’s debate, noting that she was up against a “uniquely difficult” opponent in former President Donald Trump. Asked whether the debate moved the needle at all for voters, Coons argued that it did by mobilizing Harris’ supporters and possibly swaying some undecided voters. “I also think it will move what is a very small number of unpersuaded voters, or voters who’ve gone back and forth,” he said. The senator from Delaware also criticized Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets. “That was a misleading story that had, I would argue, ill intent, that had already been debunked, and was deployed almost on cue by Donald Trump to make what was a fairly vicious anti-migrant slur,” Coons said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a cognitive test to be given to Donald Trump, saying his debate performance Tuesday night left him doubting the former president’s mental acuity. Jeffries pointed to Trump’s echoing of false claims that Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating residents’ pet dogs and cats. “It was hard to follow some elements of the debate when the Republican nominee is making up stories about people eating cats and dogs. You can’t make this stuff up,” Jeffries said. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance dismissed the impact of Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Harris, arguing she is a billionaire and is “fundamentally disconnected” from the interests and problems of most Americans.   “When grocery prices go by up by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn’t hurt Taylor Swift. When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn’t affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country,” Vance told Fox News.  Swift signed her endorsement as “Childless Cat Lady,” in obvious reference to Vance’s controversial past comments. Vance said his pitch to women voters is that former president Trump will return public safety and an affordable cost of living. “Donald Trump delivered policies that lower the prices of groceries, lower the prices of housing, and most importantly, Donald Trump delivered public safety in our country,” Vance said.  As the vice presidential debate approaches in October, Vance said he is aiming to be “as well-versed in the policy” as possible. “The way that I think about this is it’s an opportunity,” Vance said. “I get 90 minutes to talk to the American people about how Donald Trump can make their lives better.”  “We’re going to talk about a lot of policy. I’m trying to read and just understand as much as possible, you know, what Tim Walz has done, what policies he supported, and how it’s so different from the prosperity and peace that Donald Trump delivered,” Vance said.  A new ad launched by the Trump campaign on Wednesday features clips of Kamala Harris’ high-profile interview with CNN earlier this month, while slamming the vice president and the Biden administration over inflation. The ad opens with a clip of Harris saying that “Bidenomics is working” — a soundbite frequently referenced in pro-Trump ads — and proceeds to clips of news coverage about inflation, including one from Harris’ CNN interview, in which she is pressed on the cost of living. “When it comes to the economy, groceries were less expensive, housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was president,” CNN’s Dana Bash says in the interview clip. The ad’s narrator picks up, “Yet, Harris still says Bidenomics is working. No, it isn’t.” The economy and inflation have been a major point of attack for Trump and his Republican allies, in addition to their emphasis on immigration and crime. Several of the most recent ads from the Trump campaign have focused on prices, including one saying that “Kamala Harris cast the tie breaking vote that created America’s inflation,” a reference to the party-line vote on the Inflation Reduction Act. The new ad began airing this afternoon in Georgia, and the Trump campaign’s quick deployment of soundbites from Harris’ first major interview since becoming the Democratic nominee underscores the Harris campaign’s cautious approach to press availability, another point of criticism from Republicans.  Former President Donald Trump said his team is still weighing whether he would engage in another debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, after her team immediately called for a second debate in October.  “I would do NBC. I would do FOX too, but right now, we have to determine whether or not we even want to do,” Trump said, after visiting the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department in Pennsylvania. “When you don’t win, it’s like a fighter—when a fighter has a bad fight gets knocked out or loses the fight, the first thing he says is we want a rematch. So, we won the debate according to every single poll, every single poll. Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” Trump said. “But we’ll think about it.” CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. As CNN reported this morning, a top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance. Trump said it was “very polite” between him and Harris this morning, who shook hands at the 9/11 commemoration ceremony. “Just, uh, very polite, very polite,” Trump said, when asked what he said to Harris. Several senior Senate Republicans gave former President Donald Trump poor marks for his debate performance last night. Here’s what they said: Others were more critical. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz participated in a day of service commemorating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in St. Paul on Wednesday, where he spoke pridefully about Minnesotans coming together in the wake of the tragedy, greeted volunteers and packed donation boxes.   Appearing in his official capacity as Minnesota governor, Kamala Harris’ running mate recalled learning about the attacks on the morning of September 11 in a classroom at Mankato West High School, where Walz taught before entering politics. He said he remembers experiencing “that moment of disbelief” and watching “young faces try and comprehend the horror that was in front of them.” He also reflected positively on the state responding to the tragedy by coming together as a community.  Walz’s remarks were followed by brief remarks from Cindy McGinty, whose husband died in the World Trade Center on September 11 and helped organize a national day of service commemorating the day. Walz then sealed packages of oatmeal and helped put them in boxes to be donated as part of the day of service. Harris, President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance are also commemorating the anniversary of the attacks today. All four leaders were in New York on Wednesday for a commemoration event at Ground Zero in Manhattan. Kamala Harris campaign aides huddled at their Wilmington headquarters Wednesday in the immediate aftermath of the first Harris-Donald Trump debate Tuesday night, strategizing over how best to capitalize on the momentum they felt after the primetime face-off.  But despite the vice president’s team feeling pleased with how the debate went last night – both in terms of what they saw as a strong performance from Harris as well as Trump losing his composure at multiple points – the Harris campaign is emphatic that the debate did not change the trajectory of the race.  Multiple aides tell CNN that post-debate discussions in Wilmington continue to center around the core assumption that Election Day will be extremely close, and that the hardest work remains ahead of them in the weeks to come.   Another aide said from here on out until November, the campaign will continue to operate as though the Harris-Trump race is a 50-50 race.  As for Tuesday night’s debate, the campaign is plotting ways to amplify Trump’s answers that they believed were most substantively problematic. Those answers, aides said, include the former president’s refusal to take a position on a national abortion ban as well as his comments on the January 6 riot. After receiving Taylor Swift’s endorsement Tuesday night, the Kamala Harris campaign quickly began selling “Harris-Walz friendship bracelets” in tribute to the mega star.  Those bracelets have quickly sold out, aides tell CNN. The campaign store page for the “pack of two adjustable, waterproof bracelets with clay beads” — going for $20 each — currently displays a message that the bracelets have in fact sold out.  The campaign says it is taking pre-orders with the next expected release date of September 24. More on Swift’s endorsement: Shortly after Trump’s debate with Harris, Swift wrote on Instagram, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” she said. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Trump reaction: The Trump campaign responded to Swift’s endorsement of Harris, saying that it is “more evidence that the Democrat party has become the party of the wealthy elite.” “President Trump will fight for the American worker, the struggling family who can’t afford groceries and gas, and the angel families who have lost loved ones due to Kamala’s open border policy. Taylor Swift may not understand those problems but President Trump does,” campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. This post has been updated with reactions from the Trump campaign. The top election officials from six states testified Wednesday on Capitol Hill about efforts torun a clean and fair election, as some of the first ballots for the 2024 presidential election are being mailed out.  The six officials – three Republicans and three Democrats – stressed that the election season is already in full swing, with tens of millions of voters expected to cast early ballots before Election Day in November.  But sharp partisan divides were also on full display. Some Republicans raised fears about widespread voting by non-citizens, even though that doesn’t happen in US elections. And Democrats blamed former President Donald Trump for threatening the safety of election workers by peddling the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, acknowledged that it’s “rare” for non-citizens to cast ballots — a break from Trump and other right-wing influencers like Elon Musk, who claim this phenomenon is swamping the country, and have used this lie to question the legitimacy of the 2024 results before any ballots have even been cast.  LaRose said his office caught about 600 instances last year of non-citizens registering to vote, in a state where nearly 6 million people voted in the 2020 presidential race.   Prodded by GOP lawmakers, the Democratic election officials agreed that non-citizens and undocumented immigrants shouldn’t vote in federal elections. They pointed out that this is already illegal, it happens rarely, and it is easily caught because of the extensive paper trail in voter registration.  Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, accused Republicans of spreading “paranoia around a fake problem.” He said that in his time as an election official, he has seen how these attempts to stop non-citizens from voting actually end up disenfranchising thousands of eligible voters.  “I take no pride in the idea that we have denied eligible citizens the right to vote, in far greater numbers than we would have prevented the vanishingly rare non-citizen voting is alleged to be happening across the United States of America,” Fontes said.  It’s not one election, but 51, that pick the US president. Every state and the District of Columbia has its own rules and deadlines for voting and for counting votes. The first voting officially was already supposed to be underway with mail-in ballots in the key state of North Carolina, but that process was delayed by courts that ruled ballots must be reprinted without the option of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Absentee ballots are now officially available in Alabama, although, somewhat ironically, it is a state that discourages early voting. Others will follow in the weeks to come. When do voting by mail and early voting start? Most states will not offer mail-in ballots until later in September or October. The next firm date on the calendar is September 19, when ballots are supposed to be available in the key state of Wisconsin. For all states, ballots must begin to be sent to military and overseas voters by September 21. Each state has its own rules and deadlines for how and when to request a mail-in ballot and by when those ballots must be returned. In some states, mail ballots must be in the hands of election officials before polls close, but others will count ballots that arrive after Election Day if they were postmarked earlier. Washington, for instance, is one of the handful of states that conducts nearly all of its voting entirely by mail and will accept a mail-in ballot until results are certified in late November so long as it is postmarked by Election Day. Early voting may also be done in person in most states, but that process does not get underway until later in September. Widespread early voting will begin on September 20 in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia. For specifics on your state, visit CNN’s Voter Handbook, which has the dates for every state. And read more here about voting in the 2024 election. Several Senate Democrats expressed concern about the tightness of the presidential race, despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance in Tuesday night’s debate. He added, “The electoral college/popular mismatch is getting more significant, rather than less significant,” noting that the swing states are “all very, very close,” and said that they have to win by a large enough margin that they can easily dismiss claims by former president Donald Trump that the election is rigged. “You want to win big to overcome the electoral college effect. You want to win big so that every reasonable person knows you won, and his lonely complaints about, that he should have won are really just lonely,” said Kaine. Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, also said that he is concerned about the closeness of the race. “This race is going to come down to, you know, just a few 1,000 votes probably,” he said. “Everybody is all hands-on deck. Everybody is. We have a campaign that’s not taking any vote for granted,” he added. What the latest polling shows: Harris averages 49% support across recent polls while Trump stands at 48%, according to the latest CNN Poll of Polls. That average suggests no clear leader in the race just eight weeks until Election Day. The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of the six most recent non-partisan, national surveys of registered or likely voters that meet CNN’s standards and ask about a 2024 presidential general election between Harris and Trump. Meanwhile, CNN polls across six battlegrounds found Georgia and Pennsylvania are key toss-ups. Senate Republican Whip John Thune said on Wednesday it would be “prudent” for Donald Trump to talk about the future and not continue to say that the 2020 election was stolen, a baseless fraud claim that the former president repeated in the presidential debate Tuesday.  Asked if Trump took Harris’s bait during the debate, such as when she challenged the size of Trump’s rallies, Thune downplayed the impact the debate will have on voters.   “I just think the debate isn’t going to change much and she still has to answer for her record,” he said. Thune said he and most Senate Republicans support Ukraine in in its war with Russia when he was asked about Trump’s refusal to say if Ukraine should win. “My position is that we want Ukraine to win the war. For sure. I will let him speak for his position but we had 32 out of 49 Republicans who voted to support Ukraine in their efforts to defeat the Russians,” he said. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, a former GOP presidential nominee himself, said he’s concerned that former President Donald Trump refused to say that Ukraine should win the war against Russia during Tuesday night’s presidential debate. Romney also said that he doesn’t think the debate will move the needle. “There are a few exceptions to that, but in last night’s debate I thought President Trump prosecuted his case as he wanted to. I think the Vice President was able to demonstrate that people’s questions about could she answer questions from the media or not, those were answered well. She spoke well and clearly, and I think she prosecuted her case as well,” he told CNN. Romney, a frequent critic of Trump, called the debate a “classic President Trump performance,” and added that Harris was able to introduce herself to the American people. “Most people didn’t know her terribly well, other than a few clips that that were not flattering that you might see on the internet,” said Romney. “And people saw, ‘Oh, actually, she’s an intelligent, capable person who has a point of view on issues,’ and she demonstrated that time and again.” The Utah Republican said it was “no surprise” that the baseless claims about Haitian migrants eating pets came from Trump, adding that the former president should “just stick to the issues.” Several Republicans refused to discuss the debate, including Sen. Todd Young, who has refused to back Trump. “I’ll talk to you after the election,” he said. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance visited firefighters at Engine Company 4 Ladder Company 15 in New York City, where they stayed for about 45 minutes. They came to the station after the 9/11 commemoration ceremony held at Ground Zero.  Trump and Vance moved their way through the station, shaking hands, taking pictures and visiting with people. They all took a group photo with Trump and Vance standing in the middle with a large FDNY sign behind them. Trump waved to reporters across the street. He raised his fist and gave a thumbs up.  Five Danish firefighters were at the fire station “to show some respect for the firefighters,” Kasper Hinge said. “The first thing he said was who are these good-looking guys or good-looking gentlemen,” Hinge, one of the firefighters told CNN about their interaction with Trump. “Then we told him that we were firefighters from Denmark and he looked me in the eyes and said, ‘oh, your country has other problems,’” he said. “Then he left, and I’m not sure what he meant about it.” Hinge said he was a little starstruck by Trump’s visit but “we’re not that much into American politicians.” Asked if they believe foreign leaders are laughing at Trump, as Vice President Harris said during the debate on Tuesday night, another firefighter said, “Some might.” Specifically in Denmark, another said, “I don’t think so, because you know it’s one of the most powerful people in the world.” Vance departed about 10 minutes before Trump, who stayed and talked with more people.  Right-wing activist Laura Loomer stood outside on the side of the fire station with Trump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. She was seen getting off the Trump plane in Philadelphia Tuesday before the debate. This post has been updated with details from the Danish firefighters. Voting for the 2024 general election officially begins today as absentee ballots start going out in Alabama.  Eligible voters can also now request and cast an absentee ballot in person.  In Alabama, voters must have a valid excuse to vote absentee (either by mail or in person) so a relatively small number of ballots are cast that way.  The voting season was supposed to start last Friday with mail ballots going out in North Carolina, but that process is delayed as the state reprints ballots after the state supreme court ruled officials must remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name. Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in a virtual coin toss before their presidential debate – but that’s about all he won. From the opening moments Tuesday night, when the vice president strode over to Trump’s podium and all but forced him to shake her hand, she dictated the terms of their critical clash exactly eight weeks before Election Day. From Harris’ point of view, the night could hardly have gone better. She came across as fresh and energetic and brimmed with a positive future vision. Trump glowered and ranted and blasted America as a failing nation and seemed off his game. The vice president, who has sometimes struggled in spontaneous situations, delivered the most imposing performance of her political career. Trump, who had gone into the debate predicting he’d prove boxing champ Mike Tyson’s maxim that “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,” was himself stunned by multiple jabs and landed few in return. At a time when nearly a third of voters suggested in one recent poll that they wanted to know more about Harris, the vice president’s performance seemed more likely to expand her coalition. Trump, meanwhile, didn’t make much effort to change perceptions about his dystopian intentions among the key swing state voters who will decide the election. While it’s too early to say whether Harris’ performance will translate into new momentum, her campaign will be optimistic that she’s improved her chances among, perhaps, 200,000 movable voters who will decide the next election in a handful of states. Read the full analysis. Oil prices are near three-year lows. Gas prices are sinking below $3 in many parts of America. So why were Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump talking so much about expanding oil production during Tuesday night’s debate? Harris, criticized for her previous stance against fracking, noted that she represented the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to open new fracking leases in 2022. Though Harris also repeatedly touted her support for clean energy solutions, she correctly acknowledged that under the Biden administration, the United States has been producing more oil than any country has in history. Meanwhile, Trump, who supports a rapid expansion of oil production, attacked Harris for policy proposals that he said would decimate America’s fossil fuel business: “If she won the election, the day after that election, they’ll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead. Fossil fuel will be dead,” Trump said. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNN in a phone interview on Wednesday that he’s “not at all concerned” about the fossil fuel industry getting destroyed because Americans still rely on oil for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. For all the candidates’ talk of promoting fossil fuel production, it’s not clear that America needs drastically more oil. (And climate scientists say that’s the exact opposite of what the planet needs). US crude prices settled below $66 a barrel Tuesday, their lowest level since December 2021, before bouncing back a bit Wednesday. Gas prices are at a six-month low, according to AAA. Meanwhile, OPEC+, a group of major oil-producing nations, is so worried about excessive supply and weak demand in China that it delayed plans to ramp up production. US oil production has already spiked to a record of 13.4 million barrels per day, according to weekly federal data. Lipow said it would be “difficult” to get US output dramatically above 14 million barrels per day because all of the most efficient and cheapest places have already been drilled. Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, is also skeptical that US output can spike. “As a rule, the president doesn’t have the power to quickly ramp up US oil production. The industry operates all out,” said McNally, who served as an energy adviser to former President George W. Bush. After closing statements, former President Donald Trump spoke for about 42 minutes and 52 seconds, while Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for about 37 minutes and 36 seconds. While the debate was designed to offer both candidates an equal chance to respond to questions, they could choose not to use the maximum allotted time. The moderators also allowed more time for responses after some exchanges. Here’s how long each candidate used: Watch CNN’s Daniel Dale fact-check claims made by former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during an ABC News presidential debate. Winning a debate hardly guarantees winning an election, but North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he believes Kamala Harris will move the needle in his battleground state after her strong showing in Philadelphia. The vice president’s answers on protecting abortion rights and health care, Cooper said, could be key to bolstering Democratic efforts to deliver the state in a presidential race for the first time since 2008.  “She was really strong on health care,” Cooper told CNN after the debate. “Donald Trump would take it all away, don’t let him fool you.” Cooper, who has known Harris for nearly two decades, said he was surprised Trump took the bait on the size of his crowds and more. “For sure,” Cooper said. “I think she knew that this was a vulnerability of his, but to just become completely unraveled, unhinged and incoherent shows why he should not be president of the United States.” Former President Donald Trump laid into ABC News on Wednesday morning after his rocky debate performance, stating the network should have its broadcast license revoked. ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Trump throughout Tuesday night’s presidential debate, quickly correcting the record for millions watching at home after the Republican pushed falsehoods on abortion, migrants and the 2020 election. “It was a rigged deal as I assumed it would be because when you looked the fact they were correcting everything and not correcting with her,” Trump said Wednesday. The former president also suggested, without evidence, that Vice President Kamala Harris was provided the debate questions in advance. Trump ultimately delivered more than 30 false claims during the debate, CNN’s preliminary count found, while Harris shared just one false claim, though she also added some claims that were misleading or lacking in key context. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt called last night’s debate “a big success for President Trump.” Leavitt deferred to Trump when asked about the potential for more debates, telling CNN News Central host John Berman, “all of the debates that we have announced on this campaign — and there have been many of them — have come from President Trump directly, so I will let him make an announcement on this front.” “I haven’t talked to the president since he made those remarks,” she said. Leavitt rejected a suggestion from Berman that Vice President Kamala Harris got under Trump’s skin during the debate, saying, “I don’t think that happened at all.” She criticized the ABC News debate moderators, as the former president and other campaign surrogates have done since last night. When asked about Trump’s assertion that he will produce a health care plan “in the not too distant future,” Leavitt said, “I don’t have a date for you this morning, but I’ll definitely get back to you with one as soon as I can.” She later added that Trump’s plan is based on the “free market” in contrast to “Kamala Harris’ radical healthcare plan,” which she called “socialism.” Philippe Reines, the former Hillary Clinton aide who portrayed former President Donald Trump during debate prep with Kamala Harris, shared a photo of his costume and make-up from the run throughs.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off on facts, dueled on policy and traded barbs during the presidential debate hosted by ABC News on Tuesday, in which Trump also veered off on a tangent about immigrants eating pets. Here are 27 quotes to understand what happened during their showdown in Philadelphia: This comes from the middle of the debate, but it is perhaps the most important line because this debate was, in every possible way, different than the one between Trump and President Joe Biden in June. That debate eventually ended Biden’s reelection campaign. This one gave Harris an opportunity to laugh at Trump, tell him he was weak and get under his skin in multiple ways. He’s talking here about Harris’ “opportunity economy” plan, but it is a line, replete with insult, that expresses Trump’s theme for the night – which was to tie Harris to Biden and also make her appear to be too willing to change her policy proposals. Read 25 more quotes from the debate here. Vice President Kamala Harris has condemned the killing of American activist Aysenur Eygi, who was killed at a protest last week in the occupied West Bank, and offered sharp rhetoric aimed at the Israel Defense Forces. Harris called Eygi’s death a “horrific tragedy that never should have happened.” Harris also called for “full accountability.” CNN has asked Harris’ office if she plans to reach out to her family. Earlier on Wednesday, President Joe Biden also said he was “outraged” by Eygi’s death and said Israel must “do more to ensure that incidents like this never happen again.” Harris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe offered a roadmap of some of the key moments from former President Donald Trump at Tuesday’s debate that the Harris team plans to harness in the days ahead.  Those moments include Trump’s comments on healthcare: On abortion: Trump recently said he would not support a ballot referendum to expand abortion access in his home state of Florida, where abortion is now illegal in most cases after six weeks. The ballot measure that Florida voters will take up this fall would make abortion legal in the state up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy. And on Ukraine: Plouffe told CNN’s John Berman that those are “three key moments we’ll see a lot about in the coming days and weeks.” Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris shook hands after arriving for the 9/11 memorial ceremony on Wednesday morning. The handshake comes in the wake of the two presidential candidates meeting face-to-face for the first time last night at ABC News’ historic presidential debate, where they traded barbs over inflation, abortion, immigration and foreign policy. The two shook hands last night at the debate, too. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have arrived at Ground Zero, according to pool reporters. Biden and Harris will honor the solemn 9/11 terror attacks anniversary at each of the 9/11 memorial sites today and are not expected to deliver formal remarks, but will interact with families of the fallen. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance arrived at the 9/11 Memorial in New York City, where they are attending the 9/11 commemoration ceremony at Ground Zero.  Trump will also travel to Shanksville later today, according to a source familiar with his plans. Wall Street sure is acting like Donald Trump lost the debate Tuesday night. Investors swiftly penalized Trump’s social media business following the former president’s widely panned debate performance. Other so-called Trump trades, including bitcoin and Coinbase, went into reverse Wednesday, while bonds and Asian currencies rallied. And some funds that own solar and other clean energy stocks rose sharply. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group plunged 10% in premarket trading Wednesday, leaving them on pace to open at the lowest level since the Truth Social owner went public in late March. The sharp selloff represents an immediate reaction to the ABC presidential debate, where Vice President Kamala Harris successfully threw Trump off his game. It’s the exact opposite of the reaction in Trump Media’s share price on June 28 after President Joe Biden’s disastrous performance in the CNN debate. Trump Media initially spiked 10% that day, before fizzling and ending in the red. ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Donald Trump during Tuesday night’s presidential debate, quickly correcting the record for millions watching at home after the Republican pushed falsehoods on abortion, migrants and the 2020 election. The decision to live fact-check the candidates during the high-stakes telecast marked a departure from recent debates and stood in contrast to the first presidential matchup of the 2024 season, hosted by CNN and moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. During the June debate, the moderators did not correct false claims made by Trump and President Joe Biden. Instead, the network provided a fact check online and on television following the telecast.  Ahead of Tuesday night’s debate in Philadelphia, ABC News did not commit to live fact-checking, but as the event got underway both anchors stepped in to debunk false claims made by Trump on at least three occasions.  Roughly 20 minutes into the debate, the former president claimed Democrats have advocated for abortion in the ninth month of pregnancy or were in favor of “executing” babies “after birth,” pushing a notorious and often-repeated false claim. Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, has said “execution after birth is OK,” Trump falsely claimed. Moderator Linsey Davis immediately corrected the record on the abortion issue. “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born,” she said. Later in the debate, Trump falsely claimed migrants in Ohio were killing pets and eating them, repeating a debunked claim that had been amplified this week by right-wing media figures and echoed by Republican leaders.  “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,” Trump said. “The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country and it’s a shame.” Muir quickly corrected Trump on the claim. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he didn’t know if he wanted to debate Vice President Kamala Harris again as he claimed he “won the debate.” Trump said if Fox News were to moderate a debate, he “wouldn’t want” Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier as moderators because he didn’t think “were good last night,” as he apparently referenced their on-air reactions to his and Harris’ debate.  Trump had previously agreed to participate in a debate hosted by Fox News with MacCallum and Baier moderating. Harris had not accepted that invitation from Fox.  “I wouldn’t want to have Martha and Bret. I’d love to have somebody else other than Martha and Bret. I’d love to have, frankly, Sean [Hannity] or Jesse [Watters] or Laura [Ingraham], you know, somebody else. Let’s give other people a shot,” he said. Trump baselessly suggested Harris was provided the questions in advance of the ABC presidential debate as he claimed the debate was “rigged.” “They had a rigged show with somebody that maybe even had the answers, I mean, I’ll be honest, I watched her talk, and I said, you know, she seems awfully familiar with the questions,” Trump said.  Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday cast Taylor Swift as a “very liberal person” who “seems to always endorse a Democrat” after the music superstar said she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Shortly after Trump’s debate with Harris Tuesday evening, Swift wrote on Instagram, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” she said. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller repeatedly stressed that Donald Trump has already committed to additional presidential debates but refused to definitively say whether the Republican nominee would participate with NBC News on September 25 – instead arguing that the “onus” is on Kamala Harris to “quit playing games” and “she won’t show up.” “I thought this was a bit perplexing because President Trump has already said that he is going to do three debates,” Miller told Kasie Hunt on CNN This Morning. “We had the September 4 debate, which was going to be on Fox, and Kamala Harris was a no show. We had last night. And President Trump already said that on September 25, we would do a debate on NBC.” He continued, “But now Kamala Harris seems to have memory holed that and rather than just saying, we’ll see you on September 25 on NBC, is now throwing out some fictional day in October.” “So very clearly, we’re going to have to go back to the drawing board,” Miller added. The Trump campaign senior adviser argued that the Harris campaign is calling for another debate because the Democratic nominee did not effectively break from President Joe Biden or explain why she hasn’t achieved her legislative goals over the past three and a half years she has been in office. Pressed on Trump’s decision to stand by a baseless conspiracy about Haitian migrants eating pets at last night’s debate, Miller pointed viewers to “Federalist.com” for proof and argued that it was “three-on-one” – Harris and the ABC News debate moderators versus Trump. Under the rules of Tuesday’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, the candidates’ microphones were muted when it was not their turn to speak. The pool reporter in the debate hall in Philadelphia was able to hear some of what was said when their mics were muted. When Trump claimed that Democrats want abortion access in the ninth month, Harris said, “That’s not true.” When Trump said he was a leader on in vitro fertilization, Harris said, “You have not.” When Trump made the debunked claim about migrants in Ohio eating pets, Harris responded: “What? That is unbelievable.” When Harris said Trump “doesn’t have a plan for you,” the former president responded: “That’s just a soundbite. They gave her that to say.” A top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Vice President Kamala Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance.  Pressed by Hunt on whether she was willing to debate in October but not September, Fulks said that the “two campaigns are going to have to agree on a date,” declining to commit.  He said that a second debate would “absolutely” allow Harris to continue to introduce herself to voters, but suggested that she is doing that in battleground states as she kicks off another tour.  Harris, he added, is “going to be out and about doing interviews.” “We know that that is a part, and we want to make sure that we are speaking to the press. But look – we have 50-something days here. Our priority has to be the American voters… And over the next several weeks, we have to campaign,” he said.  Moments after Tuesday night’s debate ended, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon issued a statement calling for “a second debate in October. Vice President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?” Fulks said the campaign is “honored” to have Taylor Swift’s endorsement.  “We’re honored that somebody who has a platform like that would use their voice to speak out on that,” he said. Registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate are closely divided over which candidate better understands the problems facing people like them, according to a CNN poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS, with 44% saying Harris does and 40% picking Trump.  That marks a shift in Harris’ favor from prior to the debate, when 43% said Trump had a better understanding of their problems while 39% said Harris did.  But voters who tuned in give Trump a 20-point advantage over Harris after the debate on handling the economy, 55% to 35% – a margin that’s slightly wider than before they took the stage in Philadelphia. The poll’s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren’t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 6 points likelier to be Republican-aligned than Democratic-aligned, making for an audience that’s about 4 percentage points more GOP-leaning than all registered voters nationally. An 82% majority of registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate say it didn’t affect their choice for president. Another 14% said it made them reconsider but didn’t change their minds, with 4% saying it changed their minds about whom to vote for. Debate watchers who supported Trump prior to Tuesday night were modestly more likely than those who supported Harris to say the debate had left them reconsidering. Methodology: The CNN poll was conducted by text message with 605 registered US voters who said they watched the debate Tuesday, and the poll findings are representative of the views of debate watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the debate and were selected via a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of debate watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points. Taylor Swift has said she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for president, ending speculation about whether the superstar singer would share her political views ahead of November’s election. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. In 2020, Swift announced her support for Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House. Read the full story. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks today with visits to each of the three sites that were hit. Harris will join Biden for a commemoration event at Ground Zero in Manhattan this morning. The duo will then travel to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Flight 93 memorial. Later in the afternoon, they will travel to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, for another wreath-laying ceremony. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, are scheduled to appear at Ground Zero, too. Trump will also travel to Shanksville today, according to a source familiar with his plans. It’s unclear whether the two parties will cross paths. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president, will also attend an event to commemorate the anniversary. His office did not say where the event will take place. Most voters in a CNN focus group in Erie, Pennsylvania, say they thought Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential debate on Tuesday. The group of 13 voters had not yet decided on who to vote for before the debate. When CNN’s Phil Mattingly asked the group who won the debate, eight voters said Harris won the showdown. Mattingly noted that Erie is “the swingiest county” in the battleground state. One voter said Harris was “more optimistic” and “more respectful” and could describe her plans more effectively. But another voter, who said she felt Donald Trump won the debate, said she thought the former president is the candidate that could improve things like inflation and the economy. One critical moment of the debate the voters reacted to was when Trump and Harris debated about abortion rights. One voter responded positively to Harris’ answer because the vice president’s “impassioned response” resonated with her. She said she still had a favorable reaction to the moment even though she said she doesn’t agree with all of the vice president’s positions on the issue. Another voter said that although she also doesn’t agree with Harris’ stance on abortion, she thought it was “nice to see the passion and believability that she stands behind and then have something to gauge more of what she says on since she hasn’t spoken a lot, solidly about a lot of issues.” On Trump’s strongest moment, one voter, who is a veteran, said he felt like the former president’s remarks about the Afghanistan withdrawal were strong. Kamala Harris on Tuesday night baited Donald Trump for nearly all of the 1 hour and 45 minutes of their first and potentially only debate — and the former president took every bit of it. The vice president had prepared extensively for their debate, and peppered nearly every answer with a comment designed to enrage the former president. Trump was often out of control. He loudly and repeatedly insisted that a whole host of falsehoods were true. The former president repeated lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. He parroted a conspiracy theory about immigrants eating pets, and lied about Democrats supporting abortions after babies are born – which is murder, and illegal everywhere. Here are some takeaways from the debate: A turning point when Harris jabs Trump over the size of his rally crowds: Harris came onstage with a clear plan: Throw Trump off his game. It was, by any measure, a dramatic success. When the vice president mentioned Trump’s criminal conviction and outstanding legal issues, he bit. When she called him out for sinking a bipartisan immigration bill, he bit harder. And when Harris suggested Trump’s rallies were boring, he nearly choked on the bait. Rather than engage on the issues raised by the moderators, including a few that Trump considers some of his political strengths, the former president went on at length about the entertainment value of his rallies, claims the Biden administration was legally targeting him and, in a long, bizarre spell, insisted – against all available evidence, that migrants were eating Americans’ pets. Trump indulges in conspiracy theories: Despite signals from even his running mate, Trump did not refrain from repeating the conspiracy theory du jour during the debate. The former president brought up the unfounded conspiracy theory that migrants from Haiti living in Springfield, Ohio, are eating people’s cats and dogs. He said at one point that “in Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of people who live there.” When ABC moderator David Muir pointed out that city officials have denied any evidence that migrants in Springfield were eating pets, Trump doubled down, saying that “the people on television” were saying it. When pressed, Trump just said, “We’ll find out.” When the debate moved to crime, Trump claimed that crime was up in the United States contrary to the rest of the world. There too Muir pointed out that, according to FBI data, crime had declined in the past few years. Fierce argument over abortion, a key issue for both candidates: The vice president, who has long been one the administration’s strongest surrogates on reproductive rights, was able to respond to the former president’s defense of his abortion policy in a way Joe Biden was not. The former president, who appointed three of the Supreme Court judges who voted to overturn federal abortion protections, has sought to moderate his stance on the issue by criticizing six-week abortion bans and reiterating his support for exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But he has also defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Read more takeaways from Harris and Trump’s first debate."
"67 million watched first Harris-Trump debate, blowing past Biden matchup | CNN Business","Updated 9:54 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T23:15:07.922Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/media/debate-ratings-abc-trump-harris-2024-election/index.html,"The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks — blowing well past the 51 million who watched the Republican nominee take on President Joe Biden in June. Tuesday night’s 90-minute matchup in Philadelphia hosted by ABC marked the first time Harris and Trump had met face-to-face, resulting in a high-stakes clash over abortion, immigration and the 2020 election results. Interest in the new Democratic candidate and how she would fare against the former president helped boost interest in the telecast. The viewership easily surpassed the June debate between Trump and President Joe Biden hosted by CNN, a face-off that ultimately led to Biden’s withdrawal from the race and Harris’ ascendancy. While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year for a non-sports event, it represented a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016, a record 84 million tuned in to the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Viewership habits have changed dramatically since 2016, and Nielsen does not account for the myriad streaming and social media platforms that many also used to watch Tuesday’s debate. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. ABC, which hosted the debate, drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million, and Fox News with more than 9 million. The debate was the most-watched on any network in at least 16 years with more than 7 million tuning in on the various Disney-owned streaming platforms, ABC said. While the presidential debates have for decades been held by the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, the candidates bucked tradition this year, agreeing to debates held directly by television news outlets. During Tuesday night’s debate, moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Trump in real-time, correcting the record at least three times as millions watched at home, drawing fierce backlash from Trump and his allies. Following the broadcast, Trump assailed the network over the fact-checks, calling ABC “the most dishonest news organization, and that’s saying a lot.” The former president, who made at least 33 false claims during the debate, repeatedly insisted the event “was three on one” and suggested Disney’s FCC broadcast licenses should be revoked due to the moderators’ conduct. In the days leading up to the faceoff, Disney pulled its ABC-owned stations from DirecTV, the nation’s third largest pay TV provider, in a bitter and protracted carriage dispute that’s forced ESPN, FX and other networks go dark on the satellite carrier’s lineup. Hours before the telecast, ABC offered to provide DirecTV a free feed of the broadcast for a three-hour period. But the carrier rejected the offer, saying it would only sow confusion and its subscribers could watch the debate on other networks."
"Following Swift endorsement, Harris makes provocative choice to play ‘The Man’ when leaving post-debate party | CNN","Updated 7:53 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T17:19:12.599Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/entertainment/taylor-swift-the-man-kamala-harris/index.html,"If song selections were a subtweet, Vice President Kamala Harris said a lot with “The Man” on Tuesday. Following her presidential debate with former President Donald Trump in Philadelphia, Harris made an appearance at a post-debate party to address supporters. It happened not long after Taylor Swift formally endorsed Harris’s bid for the presidency. “Hard work is good work, and we will win,” she told the crowd. “See you later,” Harris added before she exited the stage with Swift’s 2019 song “The Man” playing. “I’m so sick of running as fast as I can / Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man,” Swift could be heard singing as Harris high-fived and greeted supporters. CNN has reached out to representatives for Swift and the Harris campaign for comment on the song selection. “The Man” and its accompanying music video sparked headlines in 2020. Swift, who wrote the song and directed the music video, used makeup and special effects to appear as “Tyler Swift” in the project, which references stark cultural double standards between men and women. “They’d say I hustled/Put in the work/They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve,” Swift sings on the hit. “What I was wearing, if I was rude/Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves.” Swift said she had done her “research” before endorsing the Harris-Walz ticket. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,” Swift wrote. “I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.” Swift signed her post, “Childless Cat Lady,” referencing 2021 remarks by Trump’s running mate Sen. JD Vance. In a post-debate interview with MSNBC, Walz said he was “grateful” for Swift’s support. “I am incredibly grateful, first of all, to Taylor Swift. I say that also as a cat owner — a fellow cat owner,” Walz said. “That was eloquent and it was clear,” he continued. “And that’s the type of courage we need in America, to stand up.” Trump dismissed Swift’s Democratic endorsement. “She will probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,” Trump told Fox News. While several high-profile artists have objected to the Trump campaign using their music, Harris has not – at least publicly – faced similar challenges. In July, Beyoncé gave Harris permission to use her song “Freedom” for her presidential campaign. The song has since become an anthem for Harris, who has used it for both ads and at her campaign rallies."
"The debate didn’t sway some voters CNN talked to, but others know exactly who they’re backing now | CNN Politics","Updated 6:41 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T22:04:58.707Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/debate-reaction-persuadable-voters/index.html,"Joan London knew when Tuesday’s debate began she would not vote for Donald Trump. But when it ended, she was in a most unfamiliar place: ready to cast her first vote for a Democrat for president. In battleground Pennsylvania, by the way. “Harris clearly won,” said London, an attorney who lives in conservative Berks County. “And I’m now voting for her even though I have many serious policy differences.” London became a Republican when she turned 18, a fan of Ronald Reagan’s brand of conservatism. Earlier this year, she cast a primary vote for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, then switched her registration to independent because she sees Trump as an angry populist. Until this week’s debate in Philadelphia, though, she planned to honor her conservative principles and write in some other Republican. But everything changed when the former president repeatedly refused to say he believed it was critical that the United States stand with Ukraine. Trump said he wanted to end the war, and suggested he could negotiate a peace between Russia and Ukraine. “Conservatives do not negotiate with communist dictators who invade other countries,” London said in a post-debate text. “It will take Trump losing decisively to reform the GOP, and I will be back when that happens.” London is one of more the 70 voters across 10 states who are part of our All Over The Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states or are part of critical voting blocs. Her decision to back Vice President Kamala Harris was the most significant shift in the reaction we received from this group of voters during the debate and in its immediate aftermath. None of our voters who had settled on a candidate before Tuesday’s onstage meeting were swayed to change their minds, although several Trump supporters shared concerns about his performance. “She was ready,” said Chris Mudd, a Trump loyalist from Cedar Falls, Iowa. But he added: “Trump can make some positive changes. Kamala is all hat and no cattle.” Lisa Reissman, a Harris supporter in Wisconsin, had a very different take. “Harris was remarkable,” Reissman said. “Trump came off as irrational and desperate.” Enthusiasm can matter in close races, and the conversation among Democrats is very different now that Harris has replaced President Joe Biden as the nominee. Even Democrats who had doubts about Biden but would have voted for him anyway use much more energetic language in discussing their support of Harris, including in their debate assessments. “She showed us tonight that she is a president,” said Davette Baker, an African American Democratic activist in Milwaukee. Larry Malinconico, a geology professor at Lafayette College in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, fits in this group. “While I have always been of the mindset to do anything to keep Trump from office, I also am now much more confident that VP Harris is a great presidential candidate.” Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, gave Harris more positive reviews for her debate performance. Several though, significantly, said she was not specific enough in explaining her policy proposals. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, a Haley primary voter who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues. “This is why I don’t trust her,” said Rooney, who voted for Trump in 2016, but for Joe Biden in 2020. “She’s not a moderate.” Rooney would prefer not to vote for Trump, but is not a fan of Biden-Harris economic policies. “He’s so disappointing,” she said of Trump’s answer about his conduct on January 6, 2021. “Kamala is right to call him out about this.” Twice Rooney emailed us to say that Trump was “off the rails” during debate discussions about immigration. “I still can’t vote for her,” Rooney said of Harris. “But I don’t want to vote for Trump. … I feel so lonely in the middle.” Rooney is from Media, in Delaware County. So is Cynthia Sabatini, a Reagan Republican and “never Trump” voter who plans to write in a conservative or vote third party unless Harris wins her over. The vice president did not do so Tuesday night. “She is a good debater,” Sabatini said. “But in my opinion, she needs to answer questions on point.” Specifically, Sabatini said Harris failed out of the gate when asked whether she believed Americans are better off than they were four years ago and again on questions about the border. “I’m undecided,” was her post-debate assessment. Antonio Munoz, too, said Harris could have scored a bigger debate win had she been more specific and responsive. Munoz is a veteran and former police officer who now runs a taco restaurant and catering business in Las Vegas. He sat down for the debate leaning Harris but not ready to commit. He remains there after. “Kamala was very poised,” Munoz said of the vice president. “Trump was Trump. Killing babies after they are born. Immigrants eating cats and dogs. How do you defend untruthful comments like that?” But Munoz said he needs to hear more before Harris is guaranteed his vote in battleground Nevada. “Not enough substance on how to continue moving forward,” Munoz said of her debate performance. Zoila Sanchez, on the other hand, is firmly in camp Harris, even though she describes herself as a Reagan Republican. “Her focus on real issues and pragmatic solutions was refreshing,” said Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent. “Donald Trump appeared erratic and out of control. … We need leaders who are grounded in reality.” Allen Naparalla, too, would like more specifics from Harris. But he is now ready to commit, after telling us in July, when Biden stepped aside, that he didn’t see Harris as up to the job. “At this point, I just want to vote for optimism in the world,” said Naparalla, who runs a winery in Cedarburg, Wisconsin. “We need something to be happy about and look forward to. Enough negativity.” Other Harris voters delighted in her success distracting and rattling Trump. “A master class,” said Marvin Boyer, a civil rights activist in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a crucial swing county. “She was calm, focused and collected. He was defensive, angry and out of control.” Several Trump supporters, too, said Harris had succeeded in knocking Trump off his game. “Kamala successfully avoided the questions and triggered Donald,” said Natalya Orlando, a Trump voter in New Hampshire. “The buildup to the debate was exciting but the debate itself was OK. Nothing new.” Likewise, Priscilla Forsyth, an attorney in Sioux City, Iowa, said, “Trump wasn’t at his best and fell for the bait a little too often. But she seemed so fake, especially when she tried to talk about uniting the country. I will never believe she can or would represent my interests.” That was a common theme among Trump loyalists: that Harris isn’t authentic. “Kamala Harris’ incessant posing and disingenuous theatrics while Trump was speaking came across as immature, rehearsed and off-putting,” said Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs. “His defensive reactions were not helpful,” Iowa entrepreneur Jaclyn Taylor said of Trump. “Kamala didn’t feel genuine much of the evening.” Billy Pierce, a Trump backer from South Carolina, pointed to Harris’ time in the administration. “I just can’t believe Kamala is talking about change when she has been in office for three and a half years.” Debbie Katsanos, a Trump supporter in New Hampshire, said, “The status quo has got to change. This was once a great country and now it is not.” Betsy Sarcone, who backed Haley in the Iowa caucuses but plans to vote for Trump in November, said of Harris: “Her memorized and regurgitated lines lack depth.” Several voters who remain unhappy with their choice even after the switch atop the Democratic ticket saw nothing Tuesday night to change their disappointment. “I want better than this,” said Stanley Tremblay, a New Hampshire independent. “I’m just afraid we’ve dug ourselves a hole we can’t get out of.” Gina Cilento, a competitive pickleball player who owns a training studio in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, echoed Tremblay’s dismay. “It’s exhausting,” she texted during the debate. “It just makes me feel so sad.

After spending Sunday at the US Open with his wife Brittany, teammate Travis Kelce, and Taylor Swift, who backed Harris for president on social media Tuesday night, Mahomes was asked about the former president associating himself with the three-time Super Bowl winner and Brittany. “I don’t want my place and my platform to be used to endorse a candidate or do whatever, either way,” the two-time league MVP said at his regularly scheduled media availability on Wednesday. “I think my place is to inform people to get registered to vote. It is to inform people to do their own research and then make their best decision for them and their family. “Every time I’m on this stage and I get asked these questions, I’m going to refer back to that because I think that’s what makes America so great,” Mahomes said. On Wednesday, Trump appeared on Fox News and was asked about Swift’s Harris endorsement. “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better if you want to know the truth. She is a big Trump fan. I was not a Taylor Swift fan,” Trump said. Mahomes was asked if he had given any thought to Trump, specifically mentioning his wife’s name. “No. I think at the end of the day, it’s about me and my family and how we treat other people,” Mahomes replied. “I think you see that Brittany does a lot in the community. I do a lot in the community to help bring people up and give people other opportunities to use their voice. “So, in the political times, people are gonna use stuff here and there, but I can’t let that affect how I go about my business every single day and live my life - and try to live it to the best of my ability,” he said. Mahomes was asked several times about his name being mentioned in the political space in an election year. “I’ve grown up with people from every aspect of life and every background. I think the best thing about a football locker room, and kind of how I’ve grown up in baseball locker rooms is people can come together and achieve something and achieve a common goal. “I think if we can do that as a nation, I think we can get the best out of each other. “I think that’s something that I do every single day. Whenever I’m hanging out with whoever I’m not thinking about their political views or anything like that. I’m thinking about the people and how they treat other people, and I was with a lot of great people this weekend.” Mahomes and the Chiefs face the Cincinnati Bengals at home on Sunday."
Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president | CNN,"Updated 5:03 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T03:11:08.968Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/entertainment/taylor-swift-endorsement-kamala-harris/index.html,"Taylor Swift said Tuesday she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for president, ending speculation about whether the superstar singer would share her political views ahead of November’s election. “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” Swift wrote on Instagram, shortly after the conclusion of Harris’ debate with former President Donald Trump, her Republican rival, on ABC News. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” Harris became the Democratic Party’s nominee in early August following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race. Later that month, Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Swift mentioned Harris’ choice of Walz in her endorsement. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades,” Swift wrote. “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.” Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Asked about the endorsement on Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump cast Swift as a “very liberal person” and said she will “probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.” Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, added in a statement to CNN on Wednesday: “More evidence that the Democrat party has become the party of the wealthy elite. President Trump will fight for the American worker, the struggling family who can’t afford groceries and gas, and the angel families who have lost loved ones due to Kamala’s open border policy. Taylor Swift may not understand those problems but President Trump does.” In 2020, Swift announced her support for Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House. Swift has spent most of her nearly two-decade career staying mum on politics until the 2018 midterms, when she endorsed two Democratic candidates out of Tennessee. She has since been vocally supportive of Democratic policies and candidates, often encouraging her supporters to vote and advocating for women’s rights, reproductive health and LGBTQ+ rights. In her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” Swift expressed regret for not speaking up about political causes sooner, telling her father Scott Swift in an emotionally charged scene that she felt the need “to be on the right side of history.” In another scene, she was critical of Trump. A faction of Swift’s supporters –- known as Swifties -– have mobilized in the 2024 election cycle, forming a Swifties for Kamala community online shortly following Biden’s exit from the race and his subsequent endorsement of Harris. The group, which Swift is not affiliated with and has thousands of followers on X, raised more than $122K during its two-hour kickoff call in August. Speakers included Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and singer Carole King. “We believe Harris-Walz will fight for our rights and the rights of our loved ones, and help make this country safer for everyone,” Irene Kim, communications director of Swifties for Kamala, previously told CNN."
Harris and Trump shake hands at New York 9/11 remembrance ceremony on 23rd anniversary of attacks | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:56 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T09:00:19.681Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/heres-how-biden-harris-trump-and-vance-will-commemorate-9-11/index.html,"President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance are commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, appearing to put political hostilities on the back burner for a moment as the nation remembers the tragedy. All four were in New York on Wednesday for a commemoration event at Ground Zero in Manhattan. Trump and Harris, just hours past their first in-person meeting at the presidential debate Tuesday night, shook hands ahead of solemn commemorative ceremonies after Harris turned toward Trump and both extended a hand. Vance and Harris did not appear to interact. Harris and Biden then traveled to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Flight 93 memorial. At that ceremony, Biden placed his hand on the wreath as the small group he was with bowed their heads. The president and vice president also stopped by a local Shanksville volunteer fire station that served as a key gathering point for families in 2001. Biden and Harris observed a display of a cross made of the plane’s scraps. Biden made the sign of the cross before walking in to meet some of the families affected by that day. Inside the fire station, Biden briefly donned a Trump hat as an apparent gesture of bipartisan unity. A White House spokesperson said the president was talking about how the country was united in the aftermath of the attacks and said it needed to return to that. He handed a hat to a man wearing a Trump cap as a gesture, and that man gave Biden his hat to briefly wear, the spokesperson said. Pictures show Biden smiling widely while wearing the hat. While candidates in active campaigning in past years have traditionally avoided politics on the anniversary of the attacks, this campaign cycle is notable for its toxicity, making those fleeting, ordinary gestures of bipartisanship – shaking hands and wearing a hat – significant. Biden and Harris later traveled to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, for another wreath laying ceremony. Trump will also travel separately to Shanksville later on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with his plans. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president, will also attend an event to commemorate the anniversary. His office did not say where the event will take place. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when Islamist terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners on September 11, 2001. Two planes were crashed into each of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Another plane was crashed into the Pentagon, and the fourth crashed in a field in rural Pennsylvania after passengers tried to thwart the hijacking. Last year, Biden marked the 22nd anniversary with a ceremony involving American service members in Alaska. During that ceremony, the president falsely claimed he visited Ground Zero “the next day” after the attacks. He actually went nine days later. The president visited the Pentagon during the anniversary in 2022. In 2021, he and first lady Jill Biden also traveled to each of the three sites of the terror attack. They were joined by former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama at the New York remembrance. Wednesday’s events mark the sixth election cycle in which presidential candidates have navigated the somber anniversary amid a heated campaign season. Over the years, the day has provided both an opportunity for unity and a window into deep divisions. For three cycles in a row, Trump – himself a native New Yorker who has repeated false claims about the terror attack in the past – has been the Republican nominee. Four years ago, then-candidate Biden and then-President Trump managed to avoid each other while both attending memorial events at Ground Zero. Later, they traveled to Shanksville, but also managed to avoid crossing paths. Instead, Biden greeted then-Vice President Mike Pence, giving him a Covid-era elbow bump. In 2016, both Trump and Hillary Clinton attended memorial events marking the 15th anniversary of 9/11 at Ground Zero. Clinton departed the event suddenly after falling ill and appearing unsteady, providing an opening for Trump to later question her health. She was diagnosed with pneumonia. Then-President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney did not cross paths in 2012. Instead, Obama attended events at the sites of the terror attacks while Romney campaigned in Nevada. Still, Romney held off criticizing his opponent: “There is a time and a place for that, but this day is not it,” he said. All of it is a distant cry from 2008, when Obama and Sen. John McCain joined together to lay a wreath at Ground Zero, putting aside their bitter campaign for at least a few hours to commemorate the somber anniversary. This is a developing story and will be updated."
"Trump suggests he won’t debate Harris again, attacks ABC over moderators’ fact-checking | CNN Business","Updated 4:53 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T14:01:46.562Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/media/will-trump-and-harris-debate-again-abc-moderators/index.html,"The day after Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s first presidential debate, it is far from clear if Trump will agree to a rematch. Multiple TV networks are eager to host a presidential debate in October. The Harris campaign, exuding confidence after Harris baited Trump on a Philadelphia stage Tuesday night, immediately said she would agree to a second debate with the ex-president. But Trump is not committing. “Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” he told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “We’ll think about it.” His comments suggest he is not altogether serious about a sequel. In a morning phone call to the co-hosts of “Fox & Friends,” he said, “when you win the debate, I don’t, I don’t know that I want to do another debate.” Then he insulted Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, the two anchors that Fox News has pitched as potential debate moderators in October. “I wouldn’t want to have Bret and Martha,” he said, before proposing Sean Hannity, Jesse Watters or Laura Ingraham instead. It is self-evident that Fox’s prime time stars, who exist more in the realm of entertainment than news, are never going to moderate a general election debate. So if that’s the starting point for negotiations, don’t expect another debate. But Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said on “CNN This Morning” that Trump “has already said that he is going to do three debates.” Miller blamed Harris for dodging Trump’s talk of a September 25 debate hosted by NBC. The Harris campaign, however, wants the vice presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance to happen next. CBS is hosting that face-off on October 1. That’s why Harris spokesman Brian Fallon said last night, “That was fun. Let’s do it again in October.” NBC and other networks stand ready to host a followup debate. Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he would theoretically show up for a debate hosted by either NBC or Fox, but first “we have to determine whether or not we even want to do it.” Trump claimed that overnight polls showed he had defeated Harris soundly in the debate, as if to suggest that a second face-off wasn’t necessary, but he was referring to highly partisan and unscientific surveys on social media. CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. Regarding a potential Trump-Harris rematch, Trump’s VP nominee JD Vance said it’s ultimately up to the top of the ticket. “Obviously, he likes these debates and he’s good at them, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he wants to step back in the ring, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t. It’s his choice,” Vance told Fox News. Trump on Wednesday also assailed ABC after the debate moderators fact-checked the former president in real-time during the prime time telecast. “CNN was much more honorable” during its June debate, Trump told “Fox & Friends,” calling Disney-owned ABC “the most dishonest news organization, and that’s saying a lot.” Trump repeatedly claimed the debate “was three on one” and suggested Disney’s FCC broadcast licenses should be revoked due to the moderators’ conduct. “They are a news organization – they have to be licensed to do it – they ought to take away their license for the way they did that,” he said."
Donald Trump’s social media stock closes at a record low after his rocky debate performance | CNN Business,"Updated 4:12 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T12:10:44.099Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/investing/trump-stock-debate-truth-social/index.html,"Wall Street sure is acting like Donald Trump lost the debate Tuesday night. Investors swiftly penalized Trump’s social media business following the former president’s widely panned debate performance. Other so-called Trump trades, including bitcoin and Coinbase, went into reverse Wednesday, while bonds and Asian currencies rallied. And some funds that own solar and other clean energy stocks rose sharply. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group plunged 17% Wednesday to the lowest level since the Truth Social owner went public in late March, before ending the day at a record low, down 10%. The sharp selloff represents an immediate reaction to the ABC presidential debate, where Vice President Kamala Harris successfully threw Trump off his game. It’s the exact opposite of the reaction in Trump Media’s share price on June 28 after President Joe Biden’s disastrous performance in the CNN debate. Trump Media initially spiked 10% that day, before fizzling and ending in the red. Trump Media has at times become a way for traders to bet on the political fortunes of Trump and the chances he returns to the White House. “The perception in the market is she won the debate,” Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, told CNN on Wednesday, pointing to shifts in Harris’ favor in the betting markets overnight. Trump is not only the dominant shareholder in Trump Media, he is the most popular user on Truth Social, the company’s only significant product. The company’s stock ticker symbol is even “DJT.” “I think if he loses, he has to sell and DJT goes to $1. If he wins, he doesn’t sell and DJT can make a run for it,” Tuttle said. The lock-up restrictions preventing Trump from selling his 114.75 million shares in Trump Media are set to expire later this month. The lifting of the lock-up agreement will free Trump to sell some shares, but experts say it would be almost impossible for the former president to quickly unload most or all of his stake without tanking the share price. Michael Block, chief strategy officer and co-founder of AgentSmyth, told CNN that Trump Media’s selloff Wednesday appears to be related to what investors saw during the debate. “Given its lack of earnings and other quantifiable metrics, DJT is not exactly a traditional growth or value play for investors,” Block said in an email. “DJT is a story stock and perhaps investors didn’t like the story that President Trump was telling the world last night.” Trump Media’s share price rallied heading into the debate, jumping 9% during the first two days of this week. But in the bigger picture, the stock has struggled badly in recent months, losing about half its value since Biden dropped out of the race for the White House in July. The owner of Truth Social fell last week to the lowest level since it went public in late March. The value of Trump’s stake in the company has fallen sharply, going from $6.2 billion on May 9 to about $1.9 billion on Wednesday."
Analysis: What to expect in the sprint to Election Day – and beyond | CNN Politics,"Updated 2:13 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-07-28T04:00:02.564Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/election-2024-key-dates-dg/index.html,"The race to Election Day in November is in high gear. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris squared off in a high-stakes debate in which Harris, arguably, got the upper hand. They and their respective running mates now have limited time to convince the few undecided voters and make sure everyone in key battleground states gets to the polls. Some voters are starting to cast ballots, but there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5. Nobody expected President Joe Biden’s campaign to implode after theshock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement. Nobody expected an assassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience. So we don’t know specifically what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect: Early voting gets underway in September. North Carolina was supposed to be the first state to send mail-in ballots, on September 6, but the process was delayed by courts that ruled that ballots must be reprinted to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name. Kennedy suspended his independent presidential bid in August and endorsed Trump. Absentee ballots have started going out in Alabama, and other states begin sending mail-in ballots later in the month. Voters in most of the country have the option of requesting a mail-in ballot, and voters in eight of those states and Washington, DC, will get a mail-in ballot automatically. The other states require an excuse for mail-in ballots. Back in school and back to work, many Americans may start to pay more attention to the election in September. There will also be some touchstone moments in the cultural zeitgeist, such as when “Saturday Night Live” premiers at the end of the month with Maya Rudolph returning as Harris – and we find out who will play vice presidential nominees JD Vance and Tim Walz. Trump was also set to face sentencing in September for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments before the 2016 election, but that has been delayed until after this year’s election. Separately, Trump’s federal trial for 2020 election interference was restarted after special counsel Jack Smith responded to the Supreme Court’s grant of heightened presidential immunity with a pared-back set of charges. But those proceedings could drag on for months. The month begins with a vice presidential debate between Vance and Walz on October 1, hosted by CBS. While Election Day isn’t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process will kick into overdrive in October. Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according to census figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump. It’s important to be sure you’re registered to vote by October, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration. US law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that’s November 5. People who don’t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won’t know the winner on Election Day. Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election. Separately, Trump’s sentencing on 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26. Also this month: Biden turns 82. After questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner. Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race. The new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It’s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event of an Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives. In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be the fifth vice president in history to oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat. On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office. This story has been updated with additional developments."
Fact-checking the ABC presidential debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:57 AM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T02:17:31.121Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/fact-check-debate-trump-harris/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump delivered more than 30 false claims during Tuesday’s presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, CNN’s preliminary count found – as he did during his June debate against President Joe Biden. Trump again delivered a staggering quantity and variety of false claims, some of which were egregious lies about topics including abortion, immigration and the economy. Harris was far more accurate than Trump; CNN’s preliminary count found just one false claim from the vice president, though she also added some claims that were misleading or lacking in key context. Here is a fact check of some of the remarks made by each candidate. Former Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that former President Donald Trump’s policies would result in a “Trump sales tax” that would raise prices for middle class families by about $4,000 a year. Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House. Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund a liberal think tank. If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP. Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco  Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that there was virtually no inflation during his administration. “I had no inflation, virtually no inflation,” Trump said. Facts First: This is false. Cumulative inflation over the course of Trump’s presidency was about 7.8%. Inflation was low at the end of Trump’s term, having plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The year-over-year inflation rate was about 1.4% in January 2021, the month Trump left office. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby  Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated a claim that migrants are arriving to the US after fleeing prisons and mental institutions. “We have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums,” Trump claimed. Trump makes this claim often, and he’s often alleged that jails and mental institutions are being emptied out deliberately to somehow dump people upon the US. Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim. Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN last year they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing. Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom. In response to CNN’s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes – a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated. And a second article that Cheung cited at the time, about Mexico’s president having freed 2,685 prisoners, was not about migration at all; that article simply explained that the president had freed them “as part of an effort to free those who have not committed serious crimes or were being held unjustly.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer Former President Donald Trump claimed during Tuesday night’s debate that “21 million people” are crossing the border monthly into the United States under President Joe Biden. Facts First: This number is false. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern borders from February 2021 through July 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was roughly 10 million, far less than Trump’s “21 million” figure.  An “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. Even if you added the estimated number of “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans have said is more than 1.7 million during the Biden-Harris administration, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in an email in June, when Trump made similar claims. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Trump would “essentially be immune from any misconduct” undertaken by him while in the White House. “Let’s talk about extreme and understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the White House again,” she said. Facts First: This needs context. In their decision in July in the historic case, the six conservative justices granted Trump some presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, but not blanket immunity, as the former president had sought in his federal election subversion case. The court said Trump could not be criminally pursued over “official acts,” but that he could face prosecution over alleged criminal actions involving “unofficial acts” taken while in office.  “The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the conservative majority. From CNN’s Devan Cole Former President Donald Trump repeated a false claim at Tuesday’s debate that has been promoted by numerous prominent Republicans in the past week, including Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance. Trump claimed that Haitian migrants in the city of Springfield, Ohio, are stealing people’s pet dogs and cats and eating them. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” Facts First: This is false. The City of Springfield and the local police have said they have seen no evidence for the claim – which appeared to originate from a Facebook post in which someone purporting to be a local resident passed along what they said was a story about their neighbor’s daughter’s friend. In a statement to CNN on Monday, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said “there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” The Springfield News-Sun reported that “the Springfield Police Division said Monday morning they have received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten.” Vance acknowledged on social media on Tuesday that it is “possible” that the “rumors” he has heard from local residents “will turn out to be false,” though he also encouraged people to “keep the cat memes flowing.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Michael Williams Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States took in billions of dollars from China as a result of his tariffs. Facts First: Trump’s claim about how tariffs work is false. A US tariff is paid by importing businesses in the United States – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. Here’s how tariffs work: When the United States puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer. Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. It’s true that the US Treasury has collected more than $242 billion from the tariffs Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods – but those duties were paid by US importers, not the country of China. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco During Tuesday night’s debate, Vice President Kamala Harris said, “I made it that very clear in 2020 – I will not ban fracking,” though she had said, while running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” 
 
Facts First: This is misleading. Harris did not make her position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence; Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate. Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president. Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Tuesday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Ella Nilsen Former President Donald Trump said the US experienced “the highest inflation” ever under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Facts First: Trump’s claim that inflation was at its highest under the Biden-Harris administration is false. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, hit 9.1% in June 2022. That wasn’t the highest ever recorded. Rather, it was the highest inflation rate in nearly forty years. For instance, in 1980, inflation hit nearly 15%, according to CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some of the earliest inflation data the BLS maintains indicates that inflation was even higher in 1917, when it was trending at nearly 18%. From CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald Former President Donald Trump claimed that when Vice President Kamala Harris previously ran for the presidency, during the 2020 election cycle, she was the very first candidate to drop out of a crowded Democratic primary. “When she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed,” Trump claimed, referring to Harris’ 2020 bid, while arguing that Harris didn’t receive any votes this primary cycle because President Joe Biden was still at top of the ticket during the primaries. Facts First: This is false. Harris was far from the first candidate to drop out of that Democratic primary when she exited the race in early December 2019 Harris was preceded by the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate, plus some others. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed at Tuesday’s debate that Vice President Kamala Harris has been the Biden administration’s “border czar.” “Remember that she was a border czar,” Trump said. “She doesn’t want to be called the border czar because she’s embarrassed by the border.” Facts First: Trump’s claim about Harris’ border role is false. Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries. A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.” Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries. (Biden also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.” Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby Former President Donald Trump repeated a version of one of his frequent claims Tuesday night that legal scholars wanted Roe v. Wade overturned so individual states could instead decide how to regulate abortion. “Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote, and that’s what happened,” Trump said. “It’s the vote of the people, now it’s not tied up in the federal government.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Many legal scholars wanted the right to have an abortion preserved in federal law, as several told CNN when Trump made a similar claim in April.  Some legal scholars who support abortion rights had wanted Roe written in a different way, including even the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but that isn’t the same as saying that “every legal scholar” believed Roe should be overturned and sent to the states. “Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,” Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. “Donald Trump’s claim is flatly incorrect,” another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university’s Health Law and Policy Program, said in April. Trump’s claim is “obviously not” true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: “Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn’t want to overturn Roe … It wasn’t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.” You can read more here. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. “Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn’t do her job,” he said. Facts First: This claim is false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. Capitol security is overseen by the Capitol Police Board, a body that includes the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate. Pelosi’s office has explicitly said she was not presented with an offer of 10,000 National Guardsmen as Trump has claimed, telling CNN last year that claims to the contrary are “lies.” And even if Pelosi had been told of an offer of National Guard troops, she would not have had the power to turn it down. The speaker of the House has no authority to prevent the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president (whose authority was delegated, under a decades-old executive order, to the Secretary of the Army). You can read a complete fact check on it here. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris met with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Russia invaded Ukraine and failed to deter him from the invasion. “They sent her to negotiate peace before this war started,” Trump said, referring to Harris. “Three days later, he went in, and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris was not sent to negotiate peace, and she has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference. “Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said in July, according to a state-owned Russian news agency. The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.” CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.” The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump repeated a familiar claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. “We wouldn’t have left $85 billion worth of brand new, beautiful military equipment behind,” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure – it’s closer to $83 billion – for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A fraction of this funding was for equipment. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday claimed that former President Donald Trump left office “with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression.” Facts First: Harris’ claim is false. In January 2021, when Trump left office, the official unemployment rate was 6.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate skyrocketed to 14.8% in April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down global economies, including that of the US. That was the highest rate since 1939, according to BLS historical records. Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. But by the time Trump left office, the unemployment rate had gone down. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that 818,000 of the jobs created under the Biden-Harris administration from April 2023 to March 2024 were a “fraud.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false and needs additional context. Trump was referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ recently released preliminary estimate for its annual benchmark revision that suggested there were 818,000 fewer jobs for the year ended in March 2024 than were initially reported. Economic data is often revised, especially as more comprehensive information becomes available, to provide a clearer, more accurate picture of the dynamics at play. Every year – including the four years when Trump was president – the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a thorough review of the survey-based employment estimates from the monthly jobs report and reconciles those estimates with fuller employment counts measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program. This annual process, called a benchmarking, provides a near-complete employment count, because the BLS can correct for sampling and modeling errors from the surveys and re-anchor those estimates to unemployment insurance tax records. The revision process is two-fold: A preliminary estimate is released in mid-August, and the final revision is issued in February, alongside the January jobs report. While the recently announced preliminary revision (which amounts to 0.5% of total employment) was the largest downward revision since 2009 (which was -902,000, or -0.7%), there have been other large revisions made in recent years – notably a downward revision of 514,000 jobs (-0.3%) for the year ended in March 2019, during the Trump administration. The preliminary revision was larger than typical, but economists and even a Trump-appointed BLS commissioner have publicly stated that there is nothing nefarious at play. Revisions of this size typically happen at turning points in the economy, when the BLS’ methodology is less reliable, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Additionally, the pandemic had a seismic effect on the economy as well as the gold standard methods used to measure it, so this large revision is likely a reflection of that. Specifically, the BLS’ model for capturing business “births and deaths” is likely overstating new firm formation while underestimating deaths, Oxford Economics’ Chief US Economist Ryan Sweet told CNN. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed that President Joe Biden has taken money from China and Ukraine, including $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Facts First: There is no public evidence that Joe Biden received money from any foreign entities while in office or as a private citizen. While investigations by House Republicans have found that Biden family members who have been involved in business, including his son Hunter Biden and brother James Biden (“and their related companies”), have received over $18 million from foreign entities, they have found no proof to date that the president himself received any foreign money. Roughly a year after launching their impeachment inquiry into Biden and more than three years into Biden’s presidency, the closest House Republicans have gotten to connecting the president to money earned by his family members is in finding that the president received personal checks from his brother while he was a private citizen after his vice presidency. Republicans have questioned the legitimacy of these transactions and used them to suggest that Joe Biden did benefit from his brother’s relationships with foreign entities. But banking records provide substantial evidence that Joe Biden had made loans to his brother and then was paid back without interest, as House Democrats have said. Biden said at a presidential debate against Trump in 2020: “I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.” The Washington Post dove into the allegations in 2022 that Hunter Biden received money from the wife of the Moscow mayor. But there’s no evidence that Joe Biden had any involvement regardless. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jeremy Herb Former President Donald Trump repeated a claim he has made on numerous occasions during his campaign – that the Biden administration orchestrated a criminal election subversion case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, a criminal fraud case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Manhattan, and a civil fraud case that was brought against him by the attorney general of New York state. Facts First: This is false. There is no evidence that Biden or his administration were behind any of these cases. None of these officials reports to the president or even to the federal government.  Attorney General Merrick Garland testified to Congress in early June about the Manhattan case in which Trump was found guilty: “The Manhattan district attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law. We do not control the Manhattan district attorney. The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.” As he did in his conversation with Musk, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorney’s office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo’s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney general’s office before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris implied Tuesday that all prospective start-up business owners will be able to take advantage of the $50,000 tax deduction she’s proposing for new small businesses, saying that it will help them “pursue their ambitions.” “I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work,” Harris said. Facts First: Harris’ point about new business owners being able to benefit from the deduction she’s proposed lacks context. “Businesses that fail before they begin to turn a profit won’t be able to utilize the deduction, because to take a deduction you have to have taxable income to deduct against,” Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN. In other words, the tax deduction may not ultimately help businesses owners get off the ground and running initially. However, it may help lower their tax burden over time, but only if they turn a profit. From CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald Former President Donald Trump said of the Biden-Harris administration, “the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs” that “bounced back and it went to their benefit,” but “I was the one that created them.” Facts First: Trump’s claims that the job growth during the Biden-Harris administration presidency has been all “bounce-back” gains where people went back to their old jobs is not fully correct. More than 21 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. Following substantial relief and recovery measures, the US started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million jobs from May 2020 through December 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The recovery continued after Biden took office, with the US reaching and surpassing its pre-pandemic (February 2020) employment totals in June 2022. The job gains didn’t stop there. Since June 2022 and through August 2024, the US has added nearly 6.4 million more jobs in what’s become the fifth-longest period of employment expansion on record. In total under the Biden-Harris administration, around 16 million jobs have been added. But it’s not entirely fair nor accurate to say the jobs gained were all “bounce-back” or were people simply returning to their former positions. The pandemic drastically reshaped the employment landscape. For one, a significant portion of the labor force did not return due to early retirements, deaths, long Covid or caregiving responsibilities. Additionally, because of shifts in consumer spending patterns as well as health-and-safety implications, public-facing industries could not fully reopen or restaff immediately. Some of those workers found jobs in other industries or used the opportunity to start their own businesses. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump repeated Tuesday past claims that he “rebuilt our entire military.” “We’re going to end up in a third world war, and it will be a war like no other. Because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan,” he said. Facts First: Trump’s claim to have rebuilt the entire military is false. “This claim is not even close to being true. The military has tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, and the vast majority of it predates the Trump administration,” Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, told CNN in November. Harrison said in a November email: “Moreover, the process of acquiring new equipment for the military is slow and takes many years. It’s not remotely possible to replace even half of the military’s inventory of equipment in one presidential term. I just ran the numbers for military aircraft, and about 88% of the aircraft in the U.S. military inventory today (including Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft) were built before Trump took office. In terms of fighters in particular, we still have F-16s and F- 15s in the Air Force that are over 40 years old.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump complained that the US had given $250 billion to $275 billion in aid to Ukraine while European countries had given just $100 billion to $150 billion even though they are located closer to Ukraine. Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. In total, European countries have contributed significantly more aid to Ukraine than the US has during and just before the Russian invasion began in early 2022, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany.  The Kiel Institute, which closely tracks aid to Ukraine, found that, from late January 2022 (just before Russia’s invasion in February 2022) through June 2024, the European Union and individual European countries had committed a total of about $207 billion to Ukraine, in military, financial and humanitarian assistance, compared to about $109 billion (€98.4 billion) committed by the US. Europe also exceeded the US in aid that had actually been “allocated” to Ukraine – defined by the institute as aid either delivered or specified for delivery – at about $122 billion (€110.21 billion) for Europe compared to about $83 billion (€75.1 billion) for the US. In addition, Europe had committed more total military aid to Ukraine, at about $88 billion (79.57 billion euro) to about $72 billion (64.87 billion euro) for the US. The US narrowly led on military aid that had actually been allocated, at about $56.91 billion for the US (51.58 billion euro) to about $56.84 billion for Europe (51.52 billion euro), but that was nowhere near the lopsided margin Trump suggested. It’s important to note that it’s possible to come up with different totals using different methodology. And the Kiel Institute found that Ukraine itself was getting only about half of the money in a 2024 US bill that had widely been described as a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine; the institute said the rest of the funds were mostly going to the Defense Department. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that “crime in this country is through the roof.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that crime rates are up is false. And while it is true that the FBI’s most recent data did not include some large cities, crime counts still show a downward trend as both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. There are limitations to the FBI-published data from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data and the submitted data usually has some errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. The preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% decline in murder and a roughly 6% decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in Trump’s last calendar year in office in 2020. The preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said in an email to CNN last week: There is ample evidence that crime is falling in 2024 and murder specifically fell at the fastest – or one of the fastest – paces ever recorded in 2023 and again in 2024.” Asher continued: “The evidence comes from a variety of sources including the FBI’s quarterly data, the CDC, the Gun Violence Archive, and our newly launched Real-Time Crime Index. We show a 5 percent decline in violent crime – including a 16 percent decline in murder – and a 9 percent decline in property crime through June 2024 in over 300 cities with available data so far this year. Data from these various sources suggest the US murder rate was down significantly in 2023 relative to 2020/2021 highs but still slightly above 2019’s level.” After Trump claimed in June that “crime is so much up,” Anna Harvey, a political science professor and director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University, noted to CNN that the claim is contradicted both by the data from the FBI and from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents 70 large US police forces. She said: “It would be more accurate to say that crime is so much down.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the Central Park Five pleaded guilty to crimes, and that the five teenagers “badly hurt a person, killed a person” in the 1989 attack. Facts First: These claims are false. The Central Park Five did not plead guilty, they were convicted by a jury at trial (that conviction has since been vacated). Also, the five teenagers were accused of raping a jogger – not of murder.  Five teenagers who were accused of raping a jogger in 1989 were pressured into giving false confessions. They were exonerated in 2002 when DNA evidence linked another person to the crime. The teenagers sued the city, and the case was settled in 2014. A sixth teenager charged in the attack did plead guilty to robbery charges. His conviction was also overturned because there was no physical evidence connecting him to either the rape or the robbery, and because people who blamed the sixth teen later recanted. From CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz Former President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday that he “ended” the Nord Stream pipeline. “I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one,” Trump said. “But he ended the XL pipeline – the XL pipeline in our country, he ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany; the biggest pipeline in the world.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He did not “end” Nord Stream. While he did sign a bill that included sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around 90% complete – and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump’s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been described as a likely act of sabotage. From CNN’s Daniel Dale  Former President Donald Trump claimed that some states allow people to execute babies, in addition to allowing abortion in the ninth month, and he singled out the governors including Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz for his stance on the issue. On Walz, Trump said, “He also says execution after birth – it’s execution, no longer abortion because the baby is born – is OK. And that’s not OK with me.” “They have abortion in the ninth month. They even have – and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia not the current governor he’s doing an excellent job. But the governor before, he said, ‘The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,’ in other words, ‘We’ll execute the baby,’” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s claim about infanticide is false. No state allows for the execution of a baby after it is born. That’s called infanticide, which is illegal in every state. “Every state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,” Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said in June. “There is no basis for this claim,” Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, also said at the time. There are some cases in which parents choose palliative care, a kind of care that can provide relief for the symptoms and stress of a deadly illness or condition that gives the baby just minutes, hours or days to live. That is not the same as executing a baby. Trump also misspoke. It was not the governor of West Virginia, it was the former Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam who made a controversial remark in 2019 that many Republicans said sounded like he supported infanticide. Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, said his words were being misinterpreted. In any case, infanticide was not legal when Northam was governor of Virginia nor was it ever legal in West Virginia either. As for abortions in the ninth month, Minnesota is one of a handful of states that allow abortion at any stage of a pregnancy, but it doesn’t mean that doctors perform them. Nationally, just 0.9% of abortions in 2021 – the latest year the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has data – happened at 21 weeks or later. Many abortions at this point in the pregnancy are necessary due to serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies. More than 93 percent of abortions were conducted before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the CDC. In Minnesota, according to state data for 2022, of the 12,175 abortions in the state, only two happened between the 25 and 30th week of pregnancy. None happened after the 30th week of pregnancy that year. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” for years, until he “got them to pay up” by threatening not to follow through on the alliance’s collective defense clause. “For years, we were paying almost all of NATO,” he said. “We were being ripped off by European nations, both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, ‘if you don’t pay, we’re not going to protect you.’ Otherwise we would have never gotten it.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” needs context. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “almost all.” And Trump’s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016. The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 65% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany. Erwan Lagadec, an expert on NATO as a research professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP. From CNN’s Daniel Dale In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump once again claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris wants to get rid of private health insurance. “But she won’t improve private insurance for people, private medical insurance,” Trump said. “That’s another thing she doesn’t want to give. People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they wanna have private – she wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is outdated. While Harris did say in her first presidential campaign in 2019 that she wanted to eliminate private health insurance, the plan she rolled out later that year included a role for private insurers, and as vice president, she has supported bolstering the Affordable Care Act. Coverage on the Obamacare exchanges are offered by private insurers. At a CNN town hall in January 2019, Harris, who was then a California senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, said that she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All, a government-run health insurance proposal promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Harris was a co-sponsor of Sanders’ bill, which called for essentially getting rid of the private insurance market. A furor erupted, and her national press secretary and an adviser quickly walked back her comment, saying she was open to multiple paths to Medicare for All. And private insurers were included in the plan she rolled out in July 2019. “We will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits,” Harris wrote in a Medium post about her plan. “Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around.” Since she was named President Joe Biden’s vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market. Harris’ campaign has confirmed that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system. From CNN’s Tami Luhby Vice President Kamala Harris claimed Tuesday that the economy has added over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs during the Biden-Harris administration. Facts First: Harris was rounding up and was referring to labor market data available through July 2024, which showed the US economy added 765,000 manufacturing jobs from the first full month of the Biden-Harris administration, February 2021. Though it’s worth noting that the growth almost entirely occurred in 2021 and 2022 (with 746,000 manufacturing jobs added starting in February 2021) before a relatively flat 2023 and through the first seven months of 2024. In August, the US economy lost an estimated 24,000 manufacturing jobs, bringing that tally down to 739,000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics’ preliminary employment data released Friday. The gain during the Biden-Harris era is, however, over 800,000 using non-seasonally-adjusted figures that are also published by the federal government – in fact, the non-seasonally adjusted gain is 874,000 through August – so there is at least a defensible basis for Harris’ claim. However, seasonally adjusted data smooths out volatility and is traditionally used to observe trends. An estimated 172,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during former President Donald Trump’s administration, however, most of those losses occurred following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. From February 2017, the first full month that Trump was in office, through February 2020, the US economy added 414,000 manufacturing jobs, BLS data shows. Presidential terms don’t start and end in a vacuum, and economic cycles can carry over regardless of party. Additionally, the ups and downs of the labor market and the broader economy are influenced by factors beyond a single president, although specific economic policies can influence economic and job growth. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday night’s debate that he saved Obamacare, his predecessor’s landmark health reform law that Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace. “I had a choice to make: Do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it,” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s claim is misleading. The only reason Obamacare wasn’t repealed was because congressional Republicans could not amass enough votes to kill the law in 2017. During Trump’s administration, he and his officials took many steps to weaken the Affordable Care Act, though they did continue to operate the Obamacare exchanges. Within hours of taking the oath of office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at rolling back Obamacare – stating that the administration’s official policy was “to seek the prompt repeal” of the Affordable Care Act. Although Congress failed to repeal it, Trump did manage to undermine the law, which led to a decline in enrollment. He cut the open enrollment period in half, to only six weeks. He also slashed funding for advertising and for navigators, who are critical to helping people sign up. At the same time, he increased the visibility of insurance agents who can also sell non-Obamacare plans. Trump signed an executive order in October 2017 making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have lower premiums than Affordable Care Act plans – but in exchange for fewer protections and benefits. And he ended subsidy payments to health insurers to reduce eligible enrollees’ out-of-pocket costs. Plus, his administration refused to defend several central provisions of the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican-led states, arguing that key parts of Obamacare should be invalidated. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the challenge and left the law in place. Enrollment declined until the final year of his term, which was in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. From CNN’s Tami Luhby Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday, “As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.” Facts First: This claim is misleading. While US service members are not engaged in major wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, US service members have come under fire in the Middle East repeatedly over the last year and increasingly been in harm’s way since Hamas’ attacks on Israel last October. There are currently roughly 2,500 US troops in Iraq, who have come under repeated fire since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7. Also since October, more US troops have deployed to the Middle East, including on Navy ships to the Gulf of Oman and Red Sea. CNN cited two US officials in reporting Tuesday that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was last operating near the Gulf of Oman, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group is expected to leave the region this week after last operating in the same area. Additionally, in the last several months, US service members have taken fire in the Middle East and been injured or killed. Last month, eight US service members were treated for traumatic brain injuries and smoke inhalation after a drone struck Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria. In January, three US soldiers were killed, and dozens more were injured, in an attack on a small outpost in Jordan called Tower 22. The same month, two US Navy SEALs died after going missing one night at sea while trying to seize lethal aid being transported from Iran to Yemen. From CNN’s Haley Britzky Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday’s debate: “Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs.” Facts First: This needs context. It’s true that the US lost 178,000 manufacturing jobs during Trump’s presidency – but the loss overwhelmingly occurred because of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. From the beginning of Trump’s presidency in January 2017 through February 2020, before the pandemic crash, there was a gain of 414,000 manufacturing jobs. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday’s debate: “Let’s be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we’ve ever seen in the history of America.” Facts First: This needs context. It’s true that there were high trade deficits during the Trump administration. The seasonally adjusted 2020 goods trade deficit, about $901.5 billion, was the highest on record at the time. However, Harris did not acknowledge that trade deficits have been even higher during the Biden-Harris administration. The seasonally adjusted goods trade deficit exceeded $1 trillion in each of 2021, 2022 and 2023. From CNN’s Daniel Dale"
