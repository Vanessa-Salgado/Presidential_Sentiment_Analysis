Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president | CNN,"Updated 11:35 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-11T03:11:08.968Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/entertainment/taylor-swift-endorsement-kamala-harris/index.html,"Taylor Swift said Tuesday she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for president, ending speculation about whether the superstar singer would share her political views ahead of November’s election. “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” Swift wrote on Instagram, shortly after the conclusion of Harris’ debate with former President Donald Trump, her Republican rival, on ABC News. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” Harris became the Democratic Party’s nominee in July following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race. In August, Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Swift mentioned Harris’ choice of Walz in her endorsement. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades,” Swift wrote. “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.” Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. In 2020, Swift announced her support for Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House. Swift has spent most of her nearly two-decade career staying mum on politics until the 2018 midterms, when she endorsed two Democratic candidates out of Tennessee. She has since been vocally supportive of Democratic policies and candidates, often encouraging her supporters to vote and advocating for women’s rights, reproductive health and LGBTQ+ rights. In her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” Swift expressed regret for not speaking up about political causes sooner, telling her father Scott Swift in an emotionally charged scene that she felt the need “to be on the right side of history.” In another scene, she was critical of Trump. A faction of Swift’s supporters –- known as Swifties -– have mobilized in the 2024 election cycle, forming a Swifties for Kamala community online shortly following Biden’s exit from the race and his subsequent endorsement of Harris. The group, which Swift is not affiliated with and has thousands of followers on X, raised more than $122K during its two-hour kickoff call in August. Speakers included Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and singer Carole King. “We believe Harris-Walz will fight for our rights and the rights of our loved ones, and help make this country safer for everyone,” Carly Long, communications director of Swifties for Kamala, previously told CNN."
Takeaways from the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:42 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-11T02:31:44.036Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/debate-takeaways-trump-harris/index.html,"Kamala Harris baited Donald Trump for nearly all of the 1 hour and 45 minutes of their first and potentially only debate on Tuesday night – and Trump took every bit of it. The vice president had prepared extensively for their debate, and peppered nearly every answer with a comment designed to enrage the former president. She told Trump that world leaders were laughing at him, and military leaders called him a “disgrace.” She called Trump “weak” and “wrong.” She said Trump was fired by 81 million voters – the number that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020. “Clearly, he’s having a very difficult time processing that,” she said. Trump was often out of control. He loudly and repeatedly insisted that a whole host of falsehoods were true. The former president repeated lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. He parroted a conspiracy theory about immigrants eating pets, and lied about Democrats supporting abortions after babies are born – which is murder, and illegal everywhere. He painted a dire picture of the United States, reminiscent of the “American carnage” he’d warned of when he was inaugurated in 2017. “We have a nation that is dying,” Trump said Tuesday night. As the debate ended, Harris got another boost: Musician and pop culture icon Taylor Swift posted on Instagram that she was backing the Democratic ticket. She signed her post “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady” — a reference to controversial comments by Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, that have alienated many women. Here are some quick takeaways from the first portion of the debate: Harris came onstage with a clear plan: Throw Trump off his game. It was, by any measure, a dramatic success. When the vice president mentioned Trump’s criminal conviction and outstanding legal issues, he bit. When she called him out for sinking a bipartisan immigration bill, he bit harder. And when Harris suggested Trump’s rallies were boring, he nearly choked on the bait. Rather than engage on the issues raised by the moderators, including a few that Trump considers some of his political strengths, the former president went on at length about the entertainment value of his rallies, claims the Biden administration was legally targeting him and, in a long, bizarre spell, insisted – against all available evidence, that migrants were eating Americans’ pets. “In Springfield,” Trump said, after Harris criticized him for tanking the immigration bill, “they’re eating the dogs, they’re eating the cats.” Harris looked on as though she was puzzled, but rarely returned to the claims, apparently content to allow Trump go off. Trump seemed especially aggrieved by the vice president’s aside about his campaign events. Even after Muir sought to redirect the debate to immigration – again, one of Trump’s preferred topics – the former president refused to let it go. “First, let me respond as to the rallies,” Trump said, first mocking Harris’s crowds, then turning back to his own. “People don’t leave my rallies, we have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.” The first hour of the debate then ended much like it began – with Trump off on a long, narrowcast tangent about the 2020 election, which he claimed, falsely once again, was stolen from him. When Harris and Trump walked onto stage in Philadelphia, it was the first time they’d met in person. Trump, after all, skipped Biden’s inauguration. Harris set the tone by walking across the six feet separating her podium from Trump’s and reaching out for a handshake. She introduced herself and said, “Let’s have a good debate.” “Nice to see you,” Trump responded. It was the first handshake in a presidential debate since Trump and Hillary Clinton squared off in 2016. Trump famously loomed uncomfortably close to Clinton during their town hall-style debate. Trump generally looked forward as Harris spoke, while the vice president communicated through facial expressions. She laughed at some Trump comments, smirked at others, shook her head at some and at times appeared bemused. When Trump repeated a debunked myth about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, Harris laughed mockingly while shrugging and pointing at Trump. Despite signals from even his running mate, Trump did not refrain from repeating the conspiracy theory du jour during the debate. The former president brought up the unfounded conspiracy theory that migrants from Haiti living in Springfield, Ohio, are eating people’s cats and dogs. He said at one point “in Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of people who live there.” When ABC moderator David Muir pointed out that city officials denied any evidence that migrants in Springfield were actually eating pets, Trump doubled down saying “the people on television” were saying it. When pressed, Trump just said, “We’ll find out.” When the debate moved to crime, Trump claimed that crime was up in the United States contrary to the rest of the world. There too Muir pointed out that, according to FBI data, crime had actually declined in the past few years. Trump, again, deferred to a different conspiracy theory that the FBI is deeply corrupt and issuing “defrauding statements.” He argued “it was a fraud.” Later in the debate, Trump argued that US elections are “a mess” and claimed that Democrats are trying to get undocumented immigrants to vote in elections. Few moments highlighted the difference between Biden’s June debate performance and Harris’ on Tuesday as much as the abortion debate. The vice president, who has long been one the administration’s strongest surrogates on reproductive rights, was able to respond to the former president’s defense of his abortion policy in a way Biden was not. The former president, who appointed three of the Supreme Court judges who overturned federal abortion protections, has sought to moderate his stance on the issue by criticizing six-week abortion bans and reiterating his support for exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But he has also defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade. “Now it’s not tied up in the federal government,” Trump said. “I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it.” Trump repeated several of the arguments he made about abortion during his June debate with Biden. He argued that “everyone” wanted the issue returned to the states, despite widespread resistance from Democrats and some independents. He argued inaccurately that a former governor of Virginia said that babies should be executed – a reference to comments former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, a doctor, made about care for births after nonviable pregnancies. And Trump repeated the false claim that some states allow abortions to be performed after a baby has been born, which drew a fact check from ABC News’ Linsey Davis. “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born,” Davis said. Harris responded by highlighting cases where women have been unable to get abortions after being victims of rape or struggled to get miscarriage care. “You want to talk about this is what people wanted?” Harris said. “Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term, suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail, and she’s bleeding out in a car in the parking lot – she didn’t want that.” Seeking to introduce herself to voters, Harris set the tone early, drawing contrast with Trump by framing herself as an advocate for middle-class Americans – and framing her opponent as self-absorbed. “Donald Trump has no plan for you,” Harris said in response to a question on the economy, looking into the camera in a direct appeal to voters. Leaning into her personal biography as she cast herself as a “middle class kid,” Harris outlined an economic vision including tax cuts for families and tax deductions for small businesses, while Trump, she said, will “do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.” Trump, Harris continued, “actually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.” Her campaign has argued in its ads and talking points that Trump is a candidate looking out for himself, and Harris took that message to the debate stage Tuesday. “I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. And I’ll tell you: I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first,” she said. When Trump was asked about his comment last month falsely claiming Harris only recently started to identify as Black, the former president defended his remarks as something he’d read somewhere. “I couldn’t care less,” Trump said. “Whatever she wants to be is OK with me.” In the weeks since those comments, the vice president has avoided engaging in that personal attack beyond calling it the “same old tired playbook.” At the Philadelphia event, however, Harris responded to Trump’s attacks on her identity a meaningful way. But instead of defending her indisputable racial identity, the vice president laid out the former president’s history of past racial discrimination and racist behavior. That history includes investigations of housing discrimination, calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five – young teenagers of color falsely accused and convicted of raping and assaulting a woman in the New York park – and fueling the false birther allegation that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United states. “And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this,” Harris said. “We see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don’t want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other.” Trump pushed back, arguing that others, such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, also supported the case against the Central Park Five. He called the Biden-Harris administration divisive and argued that the vice president’s examples were outdated. “This is a person that has to stretch back years – 40, 50 years ago – because there’s nothing now,” he said. If anyone on stage Tuesday has a clear, point-by-point plan for ending the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, they did not share it with the viewers at home. Asked how she would secure peace in Gaza, Harris first recalled the horrors of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks inside Israel. She offered some mild criticism of Israel’s response, an ongoing bombardment that’s killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, before pivoting to her support for a two-state solution, Israel’s right to defend itself and a commitment to rebuilding Gaza. “We need a ceasefire deal and we need the hostages out,” Harris declared. Biden and others recently conceded such an agreement is a long way off. Trump offered even fewer details. “She hates Israel,” he said of Harris, adding that she also hates “Arabs.” Trump has occasionally sought to inflame anger among Arab Americans over Biden’s handling of the conflict. But on Tuesday he quickly abandoned the tactic, instead chiding Harris for slighting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a recent visit to Capitol Hill – she did, in fact, meet with him; she did not attend his speech to Congress – and declaring again that none of it “would have never happened” if he were still in the White House. Ditto for the Russian war in Ukraine, per the former president, who – after stopping to note that he “know(s) Putin very well – said “Russia would have never ever … have gone into Ukraine” on his watch. “I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” Trump added, claiming his election would reset the geopolitical state of play and, almost by definition, herald a deal. Harris, for her part, used the Russia-Ukraine talk to attack Trump over his well-documented fondness for international strongmen and despots. “It is well-known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again,” Harris said, “because it is so clear they can manipulate you with flatter and favors.” Trump fought back there, recalling his push to get NATO member nations to pay more into the alliance and slamming Harris for Biden’s refusal to do the same, before saying the vice president “does not have the courage to ask.” Harris replied that she believed Trump might, in fact, put a quick end to the war – by capitulating to Putin. And in so doing, she added, endangering Poland on Ukraine’s western border.  (Pennsylvania has a large Polish-American population, Harris noted.) After more back-and-forth on additional flashpoints, like the US’ disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, Trump – having been accused repeatedly of going starry-eyed for strongmen – quoted the one running Hungary, Prime Minister Victor Orban. “Orban said it, he said, ‘The most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president,’” Trump said. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
Fact-checking the ABC presidential debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:51 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-11T02:17:31.121Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/fact-check-debate-trump-harris/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are facing off for the first time Tuesday during ABC’s presidential debate. CNN’s Facts First team is evaluating the candidate’s claims here. This story will be updated throughout the event. Former Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that former President Donald Trump’s policies would result in a “Trump sales tax” that would raise prices for middle class families by about $4,000 a year. Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House. Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund a liberal think tank. If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP. Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco  Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that there was virtually no inflation during his administration. “I had no inflation, virtually no inflation,” Trump said. Facts First: This is false. Cumulative inflation over the course of Trump’s presidency was about 7.8%. Inflation was low at the end of Trump’s term, having plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The year-over-year inflation rate was about 1.4% in January 2021, the month Trump left office. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby  Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated a claim that migrants are arriving to the US after fleeing prisons and mental institutions. “We have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums,” Trump claimed. Trump makes this claim often, and he’s often alleged that jails and mental institutions are being emptied out deliberately to somehow dump people upon the US. Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim. Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN last year they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing. Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom. In response to CNN’s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes – a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated. And a second article that Cheung cited at the time, about Mexico’s president having freed 2,685 prisoners, was not about migration at all; that article simply explained that the president had freed them “as part of an effort to free those who have not committed serious crimes or were being held unjustly.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer Former President Donald Trump claimed during Tuesday night’s debate that “21 million people” are crossing the border monthly into the United States under President Joe Biden. Facts First: This number is false. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern borders from February 2021 through July 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was roughly 10 million, far less than Trump’s “21 million” figure.  An “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. Even if you added the estimated number of “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans have said is more than 1.7 million during the Biden-Harris administration, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in an email in June, when Trump made similar claims. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn When contrasting her stance on abortion from that of former President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris claimed that Trump would sign a national abortion ban if he’s elected and that under Project 2025, which she alleged was authored by Trump, abortions and miscarriages would be monitored. “But understand if Donald Trump were to be elected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand in his Project 2025, there would be a national abortion — a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages,” Harris said. Facts First: Harris is making a prediction that we cannot definitively fact check, but Trump himself has not, during this campaign, endorsed these policies she said he would implement as president. Trump has repeatedly ducked direct questions about his support for a federal ban, and polls show that a majority of Americans are not in favor of a federal abortion ban. Additionally, there is no evidence that Trump was personally involved in writing the Project 2025 policy document. Noah Weinrich, a spokesperson for Project 2025, said in a message to CNN when a similar claim was made during the Democratic National Convention last month: “Project 2025 is not affiliated with any candidate, and no candidate was involved with the drafting of the Mandate for Leadership, which was published by Heritage in April 2023.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Trump would “essentially be immune from any misconduct” undertaken by him while in the White House. “Let’s talk about extreme and understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the White House again,” she said. Facts First: This needs context. In their decision in July in the historic case, the six conservative justices granted Trump some presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, but not blanket immunity, as the former president had sought in his federal election subversion case. The court said Trump could not be criminally pursued over “official acts,” but that he could face prosecution over alleged criminal actions involving “unofficial acts” taken while in office.  “The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the conservative majority. From CNN’s Devan Cole Former President Donald Trump repeated a false claim at Tuesday’s debate that has been promoted by numerous prominent Republicans in the past week, including Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance. Trump claimed that Haitian migrants in the city of Springfield, Ohio, are stealing people’s pet dogs and cats and eating them. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” Facts First: This is false. The City of Springfield and the local police have said they have seen no evidence for the claim – which appeared to originate from a Facebook post in which someone purporting to be a local resident passed along what they said was a story about their neighbor’s daughter’s friend. In a statement to CNN on Monday, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said “there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” The Springfield News-Sun reported that “the Springfield Police Division said Monday morning they have received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten.” Vance acknowledged on social media on Tuesday that it is “possible” that the “rumors” he has heard from local residents “will turn out to be false,” though he also encouraged people to “keep the cat memes flowing.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Michael Williams Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States took in billions of dollars from China as a result of his tariffs. Facts First: Trump’s claim about how tariffs work is false. A US tariff is paid by importing businesses in the United States – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. Here’s how tariffs work: When the United States puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer. Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. It’s true that the US Treasury has collected more than $242 billion from the tariffs Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods – but those duties were paid by US importers, not the country of China. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco During Tuesday night’s debate, Vice President Kamala Harris said, “I made it that very clear in 2020 – I will not ban fracking,” though she had said, while running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” 
 
Facts First: This is misleading. Harris did not make her position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence; Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate. Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president. Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Thursday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Ella Nilsen Former President Donald Trump said the US experienced “the highest inflation” ever under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Facts First: Trump’s claim that inflation was at its highest under the Biden-Harris administration is false. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, hit 9.1% in June 2022. That wasn’t the highest ever recorded. Rather, it was the highest inflation rate in nearly forty years. For instance, in 1980, inflation hit nearly 15%, according to CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some of the earliest inflation data the BLS maintains indicates that inflation was even higher in 1917, when it was trending at nearly 18%. From CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald Former President Donald Trump claimed that when Vice President Kamala Harris previously ran for the presidency, during the 2020 election cycle, she was the very first candidate to drop out of a crowded Democratic primary. “When she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed,” Trump claimed, referring to Harris’ 2020 bid, while arguing that Harris didn’t receive any votes this primary cycle because President Joe Biden was still at top of the ticket during the primaries. Facts First: This is false. Harris was far from the first candidate to drop out of that Democratic primary when she exited the race in early December 2019 Harris was preceded by the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate, plus some others. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed at Tuesday’s debate that Vice President Kamala Harris has been the Biden administration’s “border czar.” “Remember that she was a border czar,” Trump said. “She doesn’t want to be called the border czar because she’s embarrassed by the border.” Facts First: Trump’s claim about Harris’ border role is false. Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries. A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.” Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries. (Biden also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.” Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby Former President Donald Trump repeated a version of one of his frequent claims Tuesday night that legal scholars wanted Roe v. Wade overturned so individual states could instead decide how to regulate abortion. “Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote, and that’s what happened,” Trump said. “It’s the vote of the people, now it’s not tied up in the federal government.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Many legal scholars wanted the right to have an abortion preserved in federal law, as several told CNN when Trump made a similar claim in April.  Some legal scholars who support abortion rights had wanted Roe written in a different way, including even the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but that isn’t the same as saying that “every legal scholar” believed Roe should be overturned and sent to the states. “Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,” Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. “Donald Trump’s claim is flatly incorrect,” another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university’s Health Law and Policy Program, said in April. Trump’s claim is “obviously not” true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: “Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn’t want to overturn Roe … It wasn’t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.” You can read more here. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. “Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn’t do her job,” he said. Facts First: This claim is false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. Capitol security is overseen by the Capitol Police Board, a body that includes the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate. Pelosi’s office has explicitly said she was not presented with an offer of 10,000 National Guardsmen as Trump has claimed, telling CNN last year that claims to the contrary are “lies.” And even if Pelosi had been told of an offer of National Guard troops, she would not have had the power to turn it down. The speaker of the House has no authority to prevent the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president (whose authority was delegated, under a decades-old executive order, to the Secretary of the Army). You can read a complete fact check on it here. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris met with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Russia invaded Ukraine and failed to deter him from the invasion. “They sent her to negotiate peace before this war started,” Trump said, referring to Harris. “Three days later, he went in, and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris was not sent to negotiate peace, and she has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference. “Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said in July, according to a state-owned Russian news agency. The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.” CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.” The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump repeated a familiar claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. “We wouldn’t have left $85 billion worth of brand new, beautiful military equipment behind,” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure – it’s closer to $83 billion – for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A fraction of this funding was for equipment. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday claimed that former President Donald Trump left office “with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression.” Facts First: Harris’ claim is false. In January 2021, when Trump left office, the official unemployment rate was 6.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate skyrocketed to 14.8% in April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down global economies, including that of the US. That was the highest rate since 1939, according to BLS historical records. Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. But by the time Trump left office, the unemployment rate had gone down. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that 818,000 of the jobs created under the Biden-Harris administration from April 2023 to March 2024 were a “fraud.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false and needs additional context. Trump was referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ recently released preliminary estimate for its annual benchmark revision that suggested there were 818,000 fewer jobs for the year ended in March 2024 than were initially reported. Economic data is often revised, especially as more comprehensive information becomes available, to provide a clearer, more accurate picture of the dynamics at play. Every year – including the four years when Trump was president – the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a thorough review of the survey-based employment estimates from the monthly jobs report and reconciles those estimates with fuller employment counts measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program. This annual process, called a benchmarking, provides a near-complete employment count, because the BLS can correct for sampling and modeling errors from the surveys and re-anchor those estimates to unemployment insurance tax records. The revision process is two-fold: A preliminary estimate is released in mid-August, and the final revision is issued in February, alongside the January jobs report. While the recently announced preliminary revision (which amounts to 0.5% of total employment) was the largest downward revision since 2009 (which was -902,000, or -0.7%), there have been other large revisions made in recent years – notably a downward revision of 514,000 jobs (-0.3%) for the year ended in March 2019, during the Trump administration. The preliminary revision was larger than typical, but economists and even a Trump-appointed BLS commissioner have publicly stated that there is nothing nefarious at play. Revisions of this size typically happen at turning points in the economy, when the BLS’ methodology is less reliable, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Additionally, the pandemic had a seismic effect on the economy as well as the gold standard methods used to measure it, so this large revision is likely a reflection of that. Specifically, the BLS’ model for capturing business “births and deaths” is likely overstating new firm formation while underestimating deaths, Oxford Economics’ Chief US Economist Ryan Sweet told CNN.

"Melania Trump ramps up her campaign presence by raising questions about the attack on her husband, 2020 election results | CNN Politics","Published 8:46 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-11T00:46:55.756Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/melania-trump-ramps-up-campaign-presence/index.html,"Former first lady Melania Trump has begun inching more back into the political spotlight on the final few months of the 2024 presidential campaign with a series of politically pointed social media videos. The former first lady has made a rare deliberate step back into the national political discourse this week, including Tuesday when she posted a video on X in which she questioned some of the circumstances surrounding the assassination attempt against her husband over the summer. “I can’t help but wonder, why didn’t law enforcement officials arrest the shooter before the speech?” the former first lady said in the 34-second clip in which she talks directly to the camera. “There is definitely more to this story, and we need to uncover the truth.” It’s not clear what questions in particular the former first lady is focused on. Her office did not respond to a request for comment. The clip was the latest in a small series of posts the former first lady had shared to promote her upcoming memoir, “Melania,” set to release on October 8. On Sunday, her X account posted a short video narrated by the former first lady in which she made a rare statement about the 2020 election results. “The 2020 election results change our lives forever. It impacted our quality of life, cost of food, gasoline, safety and even the geopolitical landscape. America is more divided today than ever before. It has become increasingly apparent that there are significant challenges to free speech, as demonstrated by the efforts to silence my husband,” she said in a new video posted to X on that included a link to pre-order her memoir. The memoir itself is an exception to a pattern Melania Trump has largely stuck to for the 2024 presidential cycle, as former President Donald Trump has been running to become president again. The former first lady has opted against the traditional amount of campaigning for a spouse of a major-party political candidate. She made a brief appearance at Trump’s campaign kickoff in late 2022 at Mar-a-Lago, she joined the former president to vote in the Florida presidential primary, and she headlined a fundraiser for the Log Cabin Republicans in New York in early July. In April she attended a fundraiser with her husband hosted by investor John Paulson. At the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump did not deliver a speech but appeared on stage during the final night of the convention. A day after the attempted assassination attempt on the former president in Butler, Pennsylvania, she released a short two-page statement calling for unity. “This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,” Melania Trump wrote in the July 14 statement. “We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realize this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships, again.” It’s not unusual for former presidents and spouses to largely fade from public view post-presidency but spouses of nominees for president usually embrace visibility to boost their partner’s chances. The former first lady’s choice public appearances and statements suggest that she does so only when she feels something is especially important, said Republican strategist Tricia McLaughlin. “It seems she speaks up and chooses to be more publicly visible when she feels truly passionate about something – the Republican Log Cabin events, her husband’s convention acceptance speech and first (statement) after he was nearly killed, and now the matter of transparency surrounding the attempted assassination investigation,” McLaughlin said. Melania Trump’s more recent public appearances have been to highlight her upcoming memoir. Aides and allies of the former first lady stress she’s selective in how she appears in public and is focused on raising her son, Barron. Those aides and allies have also said she still fully supports her husband’s candidacy. Even so, Melania Trump herself has repeatedly described herself as a private person. Still, the recent posts were more direct than most of the former first lady’s deliberate public forays. On her website, the book is described as “the powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has defined personal excellence, overcome adversity, and carved her own path” and that it “includes stories and images never before shared with the public.”"
Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte will win GOP primary to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu in New Hampshire | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:43 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-11T00:18:29.621Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/new-hampshire-election-kelly-ayotte-sununu/index.html,"Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte will win the Republican primary in New Hampshire’s race for governor, according to The Associated Press, advancing to what is expected to be a competitive general election to succeed retiring GOP Gov. Chris Sununu. Ayotte is projected to defeat a crowded primary field that included former state Senate President Chuck Morse. She will next face former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig, who is hoping to be the first Democrat to be elected governor of the Granite State in a decade. Craig is projected to win what had been a bitter primary against Cinde Warmington, who serves on the state’s five-member Executive Council. Sununu, who emerged as a national figure largely because of his criticism of former President Donald Trump, opted against seeking a fifth two-year term, announcing last year that “the time is right for another Republican to lead our great state.” New Hampshire’s prominence in presidential primaries – as well as its independent streak – have made it the closest thing to a political battleground in otherwise overwhelmingly Democratic New England. Both Sununu and longtime Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster are retiring after this year. Ayotte, who had the governor’s endorsement, has said that she would keep New Hampshire on the “Sununu path” – a stark contrast to Morse, who offered himself as a strong Trump supporter. Ayotte, a former state attorney general, was elected to her lone Senate term in 2010, and was soon seen as a rising star. However, six years later, she lost a close race to Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, who has held the seat since. During that 2016 race, Ayotte withdrew her support for Trump after the “Access Hollywood” tape emerged, saying at the time that she “cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women.” Ayotte reemerged in Washington during Trump’s presidency, guiding Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch through his Senate confirmation hearings in 2017. Meanwhile, in the race for Kuster’s seat in the state’s competitive 2nd Congressional District, former congressional and White House aide Maggie Goodlander will win a hard-fought contest for the Democratic nomination, according to The Associated Press. Goodlander, the wife of President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is projected to defeat Colin Van Ostern, a former member of the state Executive Council who lost a close race for governor to Sununu in 2016. The primary has been marked by negative attacks from both sides. An ad from VoteVets, which supports Democrats from military and national security backgrounds and is backing Goodlander, called Van Ostern a “perennial candidate” and attacked his business record. Kuster, who had endorsed Van Ostern, her onetime campaign manager, then appeared in an ad for him in which she said that Goodlander “hasn’t lived in our district for decades” and that she “gave thousands to pro-life Republicans.” Kuster told Politico that the VoteVets spot against Van Ostern prompted her to get involved: “New Hampshire has never seen a negative attack ad like that in a Democratic ad.” Goodlander was raised in the 2nd District. She rented a home there shortly before launching her campaign and has described herself as a “renter.” But The New York Times reported that she and Sullivan also own a $1.2 million home in Portsmouth, outside the district. Federal Election Commission records also show that Goodlander contributed to the campaigns of former Republican Rep. Justin Amash, who voted to impeach Trump in 2019, and to a Republican who was challenging former hard-line North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn in 2020. Democratic former Gov. John Lynch, who served from 2005 to 2013, initially endorsed Van Ostern but then withdrew his support, lambasting the candidate’s campaign for what he described as negative tactics. He backed Goodlander instead and cut an ad for her. Lynch told WMUR he was “appalled” by the ad featuring Kuster, which questioned Goodlander’s commitment to protecting abortion rights. Goodlander will be the heavy favorite against Republican Lily Tang Williams in the Democratic-leaning district in November. This story has been updated with an additional projections."
Starbucks’ new CEO wants to make Starbucks a coffee shop again | CNN Business,"Published 1:17 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-10T17:17:20.918Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/business/starbucks-ceo-brian-niccol/index.html,"Starbucks has been on the decline, with shrinking sales as it moved from a traditional sit-down coffee shop into one where people place orders on their phones and grab a drink from the counter. Its new CEO has a plan to fix it all. And it starts with comfortable chairs. Brian Niccol, on his second day as Starbucks’ chief, said in a letter to employees and customers that he wants to return Starbucks to its roots as a “community coffeehouse” with comfortable seats, design and a clear distinction between “to-go” and “for-here” service. “There’s a shared sense that we have drifted from our core,” he said Tuesday. “We’re committed to elevating the in-store experience — ensuring our spaces reflect the sights, smells and sounds that define Starbucks.” Niccol is considered the restaurant industry’s Mr. Fix-It, having engineered turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell. He will be Starbucks’ fourth CEO in two years, taking the helm amid a slump in Starbucks’ business and pressure from employees and investors. Starbucks’ sales have fallen for two straight quarters. Some customers have expressed frustration with high prices, slow pickup orders on Starbucks’ app and lackluster food options. The company, historically considered a progressive employer, has also seen a wave of union organizing at stores stemming from frustration with working conditions, pay and benefits. Starbucks is transitioning from a primarily brick-and-mortar company to an online-driven business. Mobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks’ sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. He said in the letter that in recent weeks has been visiting stores and talking to employees and customers. He acknowledged in his letter that, in some stores, especially the United States, they can feel “transactional, menus can feel overwhelming, product is inconsistent, the wait too long or the handoff too hectic.” He said Starbucks will focus on “empowering” baristas, ensuring they have “tools and time to craft great drinks.” Some employees have said mobile orders can pile up and overwhelm stores, taxing workers. Niccol, who lives in Newport Beach, California, has garnered scrutiny for not permanently relocating to Starbucks’ Seattle offices and using a corporate jet to commute back and forth. According to the company, Niccol will spend time in stores, at headquarters in Seattle and with Starbucks employees around the world."
ABC News steps into the spotlight with high stakes Trump-Harris debate | CNN Business,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-10T10:00:19.608Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/business/abc-news-presidential-debate-trump-harris/index.html,"As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump take the stage Tuesday night in Philadelphia in their first face-to-face meeting, the spotlight will also shine on the host of the debate: ABC News. Moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis will have a much different view in front of them than when ABC News first secured the high-stakes presidential debate in May. Since then, Harris has become the Democratic nominee, shaking up not just the race for the White House but also the negotiation process ahead of the televised faceoff. It’s a big test for the Disney-owned network in what is the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump of the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign. Everything ABC News does, from the moderators’ questions to the lighting will be heavily scrutinized by the candidates and the public during the 90-minute showdown. In the weeks leading up to Tuesday night’s debate, a behind the scenes drama has played out at ABC News as network executives sought to lock down the ground rules and format for the match up. ABC had planned to mostly mirror the rules used by CNN in its presidential debate in June between President Joe Biden and Trump, eschewing a live audience and muting the candidates’ microphones while their rival is speaking — a rule initially requested by Biden’s team prior to the CNN debate. But Harris’ team wanted the mics hot the entire night and demanded the network change the rule. Some of Harris’ most memorable moments in previous debates and in Senate hearings have come during cross talk. Her campaign, according to people familiar with the matter, believed that muting the microphones will make Trump appear more disciplined, and expressed frustration that ABC was not willing to budge on the rule. The issue presented a thorny dilemma for ABC. While Democrats had selected a new candidate since first agreeing to host the debate, Republicans had not. And Trump’s campaign had already accepted the debate rules as sent out by ABC News’ general counsel. The microphones remained the final sticking point, even as ABC began erecting its physical presence at the National Constitution Center. But ABC executives remained confident both candidates would show up, and ultimately, the Harris campaign relented. In a letter to ABC accepting the rules, the Harris campaign wrote, “we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format. We do not want to jeopardize the debate.” The network, however, seemed to leave open the possibility that it could reconsider muting the microphones under certain circumstances, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations. ABC News offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, the network may choose to turn both mics on so that the millions of viewers watching at home can hear the exchange, the person said. ABC’s moderators would discourage the candidates from interrupting one other and explain to viewers what is being said, according to this person. ABC News, however, has pushed back on the notion that the microphones will be unmuted, saying in a statement last week: “Beyond the debate rules published today, which were mutually agreed upon by two campaigns on May 15th, we have made no other agreements. We look forward to moderating the presidential debate next Tuesday.” But there will be another opportunity for the public to understand any exchanges made inaudible during the telecast. Unlike at the CNN debate, a pool of reporters who cover the candidates for major news organizations will be present in the debate studio, able to hear and report on what both sides are saying, the person added. ABC News declined to comment. Presidential debates are major events for the network that puts them on. Not only are the contests significant investments, but the broadcasts attract huge ratings and are often some of the most watched events in a network’s history. For ABC News, the debate comes at a pivotal moment. Last month, parent company Disney appointed Almin Karamehmedovic, the top producer of “World News Tonight,” as the network’s next president. His appointment comes after former president Kim Godwin abruptly stepped down in May, capping a tumultuous three-year run at the outlet after staffers said her polarizing leadership led to plummeting employee morale. For Karamehmedovic, a successful debate and big ratings could offer a big boost to staff morale. ABC will also be closely scrutinized by Trump and his allies. In the days ahead of the debate, Trump has attacked the network, questioning its impartiality. And while Trump has sharply assailed the news media, calling journalists the “enemy of the people,” he has had some particular gripes with ABC. “ABC is the worst network in terms of fairness,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week. “They’re very nasty, and I think a lot of people are going to be watching to see how nasty and how unfair they are.” Trump has also baselessly suggested that Dana Walden, the Disney Entertainment co-chair who technically has ABC News in her portfolio and has been friends with Harris for years, would somehow give vice president the questions ahead of time. The network has previously said that Walden has no editorial control over ABC News. Trump is also suing George Stephanopoulos over the ABC News anchor’s assertion that a jury concluded Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll. (A Manhattan federal jury last year found that Trump sexually abused Carroll and held him liable for battery). And last month, Trump clashed with ABC senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott as she incisively questioned the former president during an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention over his past statements on race, calling Scott “nasty.” Unlike some of their ABC News colleagues though, Trump has not gone after Muir or Davis — the latter of whom has never interviewed Trump. Both Muir and Davis are experienced primary debate moderators, but neither has moderated a presidential debate between the Democratic and Republican candidates. Muir, the highest rated nightly news network anchor, has experience with Trump, scoring the first interview with the former president after his inauguration. Tuesday is an even bigger moment for Davis. Though she has moderated primary debates in the past and anchors ABC’s nightly streaming newscast, as well as the broadcaster’s Sunday newscast, she’s lesser known to the public. But regardless of the moderators’ history, their performance on Tuesday will inevitably come under scrutiny, particularly over the question of whether to fact check the candidates – or not – in real time. “I don’t think it’s a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ proposition,” ABC News political director Rick Klein told The New York Times this week. “We’re not making a commitment to fact-check everything, or fact-check nothing, in either direction. We’re there to keep a conversation going, and to facilitate a good solid debate, and that entails a lot of things in terms of asking questions, moving the conversation along, making sure that it’s civilized.” CNN’s MJ Lee and Kristen Holmes contributed reporting."
"Live updates: Trump, Harris debate on ABC | CNN Politics",No Results Found,2024-09-10T09:03:04.997Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-debate-abc-09-10-24/index.html,"        Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” for years, until he “got them to pay up” by threatening not to follow through on the alliance’s collective defense clause.  “For years, we were paying almost all of NATO,” he said. “We were being ripped off by European nations, both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, ‘if you don’t pay, we’re not going to protect you.’ Otherwise we would have never gotten it.”   The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 65% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany. Erwan Lagadec, an expert on NATO as a research professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP.  Under the rules of Tuesday’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, the candidates’ microphones were muted when it was not their turn to speak. The pool reporter in the debate hall in Philadelphia was able to hear some of what was said when their mics were muted. When Trump claimed that Democrats want abortion access in the ninth month, Harris said, “That’s not true.” When Trump said he was a leader on in vitro fertilization, Harris said, “You have not.” When Trump made the debunked claim about migrants in Ohio eating pets, Harris responded: “What? That is unbelievable.” When Harris said Trump “doesn’t have a plan for you,” the former president responded: “That’s just a soundbite. They gave her that to say.” CNN’s Dana Bash described the debunked rumor involving Haitian migrants and pets as “racist” following Tuesday’s debate. Her comment came after Sen. JD Vance defended the meme, which was also promoted by former President Donald Trump, in a post-debate interview. Kamala Harris campaign officials didn’t receive a heads-up on Taylor Swift’s surprise Tuesday night endorsement, according to Ian Sams, a senior campaign spokesperson, who also welcomed the news in an interview with CNN. “People didn’t know she was going to do that,” he said. But he said the campaign would be happy to have Swift lend her support in whatever capacity she’s inclined to ahead of the election. Former President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday that he “ended” the Nord Stream pipeline. “I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one,” Trump said. “But he ended the XL pipeline – the XL pipeline in our country, he ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany; the biggest pipeline in the world.”  Facts first: Trump’s claim is false. He did not “end” Nord Stream.   While he did sign a bill that included sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around 90% complete – and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump’s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters.   The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been described as a likely act of sabotage.   Second gentleman Doug Emhoff praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance at a watch party in Philadelphia. Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the Central Park Five pleaded guilty to crimes, and that the five teenagers “badly hurt a person, killed a person” in the 1989 attack.   Facts First: These claims are false. The Central Park Five did not plead guilty, they were convicted by a jury at trial (that conviction has since been vacated). Also, the five teenagers were accused of raping a jogger – not of murder.   Five teenagers who were accused of raping a jogger in 1989 were pressured into giving false confessions. They were exonerated in 2002 when DNA evidence linked another person to the crime. The teenagers sued the city, and the case was settled in 2014.  A sixth teenager charged in the attack did plead guilty to robbery charges. His conviction was also overturned because there was no physical evidence connecting him to either the rape or the robbery, and because people who blamed the sixth teen later recanted.   Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that “crime in this country is through the roof.”  Facts First: Trump’s claim that crime rates are up is false. And while it is true that the FBI’s most recent data did not include some large cities, crime counts still show a downward trend as both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024.   There are limitations to the FBI-published data from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data and the submitted data usually has some errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime.   The preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% decline in murder and a roughly 6% decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in Trump’s last calendar year in office in 2020. The preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime.   Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said in an email to CNN last week: There is ample evidence that crime is falling in 2024 and murder specifically fell at the fastest – or one of the fastest – paces ever recorded in 2023 and again in 2024.”  Asher continued: “The evidence comes from a variety of sources including the FBI’s quarterly data, the CDC, the Gun Violence Archive, and our newly launched Real-Time Crime Index. We show a 5 percent decline in violent crime – including a 16 percent decline in murder – and a 9 percent decline in property crime through June 2024 in over 300 cities with available data so far this year. Data from these various sources suggest the US murder rate was down significantly in 2023 relative to 2020/2021 highs but still slightly above 2019’s level.”     After Trump claimed in June that “crime is so much up,” Anna Harvey, a political science professor and director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University, noted to CNN that the claim is contradicted both by the data from the FBI and from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents 70 large US police forces. She said: “It would be more accurate to say that crime is so much down.”    Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz reacted to Taylor Swift endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president and him for vice president, saying he’s “incredibly grateful” for her support and calling her social media statement an example of “the type of courage we need in America.” During an interview with MSNBC, Walz placed his hand over his heart and smiled widely as an anchor read Swift’s statement endorsing their campaign in its entirety. “I am incredibly grateful, first of all, to Taylor Swift. I say that also as a cat owner, a fellow cat owner,” Walz said in response, alluding to the image Swift shared holding a cat accompanying her statement. Walz encouraged Swift’s supporters to engage with the campaign through its official website. “This would be the opportunity, Swifties. Kamalaharris.com, get on over there, give us a hand, get things going,” he said. Former President Donald Trump complained that the US had given $250 billion to $275 billion in aid to Ukraine while European countries had given just $100 billion to $150 billion even though they are located closer to Ukraine.  The Kiel Institute, which closely tracks aid to Ukraine, found that, from late January 2022 (just before Russia’s invasion in February 2022) through June 2024, the European Union and individual European countries had committed a total of about $207 billion to Ukraine, in military, financial and humanitarian assistance, compared to about $109 billion (€98.4 billion) committed by the US. Europe also exceeded the US in aid that had actually been “allocated” to Ukraine – defined by the institute as aid either delivered or specified for delivery – at about $122 billion (€110.21 billion) for Europe compared to about $83 billion (€75.1 billion) for the US.  In addition, Europe had committed more total military aid to Ukraine, at about $88 billion (79.57 billion euro) to about $72 billion (64.87 billion euro) for the US. The US narrowly led on military aid that had actually been allocated, at about $56.91 billion for the US (51.58B euro) to about $56.84 billion for Europe (51.52B euro), but that was nowhere near the lopsided margin Trump suggested.  It’s important to note that it’s possible to come up with different totals using different methodology. And the Kiel Institute found that Ukraine itself was getting only about half of the money in a 2024 US bill that had widely been described as a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine; the institute said the rest of the funds were mostly going to the Defense Department.  Former President Donald Trump repeated Tuesday past claims that he “rebuilt our entire military.”   “We’re going to end up in a third world war, and it will be a war like no other. Because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan,” he said.   Harrison said in a November email: “Moreover, the process of acquiring new equipment for the military is slow and takes many years. It’s not remotely possible to replace even half of the military’s inventory of equipment in one presidential term. I just ran the numbers for military aircraft, and about 88% of the aircraft in the U.S. military inventory today (including Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft) were built before Trump took office. In terms of fighters in particular, we still have F-16s and F-15s in the Air Force that are over 40 years old.”  Donald Trump immediately looked to turn the debate against Kamala Harris Tuesday night into a win and questioned whether he would participate in a second one. He said that Harris “wants to do another one because she got beaten tonight but I don’t if we’re going to be doing another one.” Harris’ team immediately called for the candidates to do a second debate. Trump’s campaign had said he agreed to do a NBC debate on September 25. Following the debate with former President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris talked to a crowd of supporters at a watch party in Philadelphia. She emphasized the importance of winning the battleground state of Pennsylvania and thanked campaign volunteers. The theme of unity — instead of division — was also a common motif for the vice president in her attacks against Trump on the debate stage. Former President Barack Obama said Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris showed she will be “a president for all Americans” after her performance in the ABC presidential debate against former President Donald Trump.  Kamala Harris’ team is pleased with how tonight’s debate between the vice president and Donald Trump went.  Harris campaign advisers told CNN throughout and after Tuesday night’s debate that they felt the vice president displayed a strong command of the issues; delivered messages she had hoped to on pivotal issues such as reproductive rights, the economy and foreign policy; and notably, successfully got under Trump’s skin — more than once.  One senior adviser said if there was one thing that consistently surprised the Harris team tonight, it was how often Trump took the vice president’s bait, including on issues such as the crowd sizes at his rallies. As senior Harris advisers watched the debate on-site at the Constitution Center, applause broke out in the room during the first commercial break, according to a person in the room. Now that the debate is over, the mood inside the Harris campaign is one of celebration. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he was worried that the country had “brain fog” about Donald Trump’s record as president. But after tonight’s debate, Shapiro said “I think Kamala Harris wiped out that brain fog” by reminding the American people of the former president’s record.   The governor said his state is “no stranger to close elections,” but he thinks Harris “understands that to pick up that last yard or two here in Pennsylvania is tough, but you gotta show up.”  Former President Donald Trump said of the Biden-Harris administration, “the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs” that “bounced back and it went to their benefit,” but “I was the one that created them.”  More than 21 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. Following substantial relief and recovery measures, the US started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million jobs from May 2020 through December 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.  The recovery continued after Biden took office, with the US reaching and surpassing its pre-pandemic (February 2020) employment totals in June 2022.  The job gains didn’t stop there. Since June 2022 and through August 2024, the US has added nearly 6.4 million more jobs in what’s become the fifth-longest period of employment expansion on record. In total under the Biden-Harris administration, around 16 million jobs have been added. But it’s not entirely fair nor accurate to say the jobs gained were all “bounce-back” or were people simply returning to their former positions.  The pandemic drastically reshaped the employment landscape. For one, a significant portion of the labor force did not return due to early retirements, deaths, long Covid or caregiving responsibilities.  Additionally, because of shifts in consumer spending patterns as well as health-and-safety implications, public-facing industries could not fully reopen or restaff immediately. Some of those workers found jobs in other industries or used the opportunity to start their own businesses. Vice President Kamala Harris implied Tuesday that all prospective start-up business owners will be able to take advantage of the $50,000 tax deduction she’s proposing for new small businesses, saying that it will help them “pursue their ambitions.”  “I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work,” Harris said.  “Businesses that fail before they begin to turn a profit won’t be able to utilize the deduction, because to take a deduction you have to have taxable income to deduct against,” Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN.   In other words, the tax deduction may not ultimately help businesses owners get off the ground and running initially. However, it may help lower their tax burden over time, but only if they turn a profit.  Former President Donald Trump repeated a claim he has made on numerous occasions during his campaign – that the Biden administration orchestrated a criminal election subversion case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, a criminal fraud case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Manhattan, and a civil fraud case that was brought against him by the attorney general of New York state.  Facts First: This is false. There is no evidence that Joe Biden or his administration were behind any of these cases. None of these officials reports to the president or even to the federal government.   Attorney General Merrick Garland testified to Congress in early June about the Manhattan case in which Trump was found guilty: “The Manhattan district attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law. We do not control the Manhattan district attorney. The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.”  As he did in his conversation with Elon Musk, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorney’s office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo’s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney general’s office before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021.  CNN anchor Chris Wallace said he didn’t think he’d ever “witness a debate as devastating” as the June showdown between former President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Wallace said that he believed Harris “pitched a shutout on almost every subject I can think of” and that she “shut Trump down.” He agreed with an observation made by CNN’s Dana Bash, saying that Harris’ message Tuesday night could be summed up by her statement that Trump is not campaigning against Biden — but her instead. Former President Donald Trump claimed that President Joe Biden has taken money from China and Ukraine, including $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow.  Roughly a year after launching their impeachment inquiry into Biden and more than three years into Biden’s presidency, the closest House Republicans have gotten to connecting the president to money earned by his family members is in finding that the president received personal checks from his brother while he was a private citizen after his vice presidency. Republicans have questioned the legitimacy of these transactions and used them to suggest that Joe Biden did benefit from his brother’s relationships with foreign entities. But banking records provide substantial evidence that Joe Biden had made loans to his brother and then was paid back without interest, as House Democrats have said.  Biden said at a presidential debate against Trump in 2020: “I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.”   The Washington Post dove into the allegations in 2022 that Hunter Biden received money from the wife of the Moscow mayor. But there’s no evidence that Joe Biden had any involvement regardless.   Vice President Kamala Harris’ motorcade is rolling from the debate site as of 11:05 p.m. ET, according to pool reporters. President Joe Biden watched Vice President Kamala Harris debate former President Donald Trump from a hotel in New York City with family and staff, per a person familiar. Biden had declined to share what debate advice he offered his vice president as he left the White House this afternoon, though he did tell reporters Harris seemed “cool, calm and collected” heading into the evening. The president is in New York ahead of Wednesday’s September 11 anniversary and celebrated his granddaughter Finnegan’s birthday earlier tonight in the city. Former President Donald Trump weighed in Tuesday on the state of manufacturing in America, saying the industry lost 10,000 jobs “in the last month.” Manufacturing’s total job losses in August, according to the government’s latest tally, were actually quite a bit higher, at 24,000. Trump, unsurprisingly, blamed the Biden administration and Chinese automakers for the weakness the manufacturing industry is currently seeing. “They’re building these massive plants and they think they’re going to sell their cars into the United States because of these people,” Trump said. “What they have given to China is unbelievable.” There’s quite a bit to untangle there. Chinese manufacturers have been operating out of Mexico for decades, but it’s true that some automakers from China have ramped up investments in the country recently to tap in to the sizable US market. As it relates to the health of US manufacturers, high interest rates and sluggish domestic demand are the main issues top of mind for the industry, according to recent business surveys from the Institute for Supply Management. The industry “contracted in August for the fifth consecutive month and the 21st time in the last 22 months,” ISM said. Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president at the conclusion of Tuesday’s debate — a crucial endorsement that ends months of speculation about whether the superstar would weigh in on this year’s race. Swift added: “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!” Swift has spent most of her nearly two-decade career staying mum on politics, until the 2018 midterms, when she endorsed two Democratic candidates out of Tennessee. She has since been vocally supportive of Democratic policies and candidates, often encouraging her supporters to vote and advocating for women’s rights, reproductive health and LGBTQ+ rights. She signed off her post, which included a picture with one of her three cats, Benjamin Button, with “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady.” This post has been updated with additional information. Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that 818,000 of the jobs created under the Biden-Harris administration from April 2023 to March 2024 were a “fraud.”  Facts First: Trump’s claim is false and needs additional context.  Trump was referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ recently released preliminary estimate for its annual benchmark revision that suggested there were 818,000 fewer jobs for the year ended in March 2024 than were initially reported.  Economic data is often revised, especially as more comprehensive information becomes available, to provide a clearer, more accurate picture of the dynamics at play.  Every year – including the four years when Trump was president – the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a thorough review of the survey-based employment estimates from the monthly jobs report and reconciles those estimates with fuller employment counts measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program.  This annual process, called a benchmarking, provides a near-complete employment count because the BLS can correct for sampling and modeling errors from the surveys and re-anchor those estimates to unemployment insurance tax records. The revision process is two-fold: A preliminary estimate is released in mid-August, and the final revision is issued in February, alongside the January jobs report.  While the recently announced preliminary revision (which amounts to 0.5% of total employment) was the largest downward revision since 2009 (which was -902,000, or -0.7%), there have been other large revisions made in recent years – notably a downward revision of 514,000 jobs (-0.3%) for the year ended in March 2019, during the Trump administration.  The preliminary revision was larger than typical, but economists and even a Trump-appointed BLS commissioner have publicly stated that there is nothing nefarious at play. Revisions of this size typically happen at turning points in the economy, when the BLS’ methodology is less reliable, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.  Additionally, the pandemic had a seismic effect on the economy as well as the gold standard methods used to measure it, so this large revision is likely a reflection of that. Specifically, the BLS’ model for capturing business “births and deaths” is likely overstating new firm formation while underestimating deaths, Oxford Economics’ Chief US Economist Ryan Sweet told CNN.  Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump didn’t interact at the conclusion of Tuesday’s debate, according to a pool reporter in the room. When the contentious debate ended, they both thanked the moderators and turned toward their exits without looking at each other. Trump walked straight off stage. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff emerged and gave his wife a smile and a hug. After closing statements, former President Donald Trump spoke for about 42 minutes and 52 seconds, while Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for about 37 minutes and 36 seconds. While the debate was designed to offer both candidates an equal chance to respond to questions, they could choose not to use the maximum allotted time. The moderators also allowed more time for responses after some exchanges. Here’s how long each candidate used: Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday claimed that former President Donald Trump left office “with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression.”   Facts First: Harris’ claim is false.   In January 2021, when Trump left office, the official unemployment rate was 6.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   The unemployment rate skyrocketed to 14.8% in April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down global economies, including that of the US. That was the highest rate since 1939, according to BLS historical records.   Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. But by the time Trump left office, the unemployment rate had gone down.    Moments after the debate is over, the Harris campaign is calling for another round. Trump has said he would do a NBC debate on September 25. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris traded attacks tonight as they worked to get their policy positions across to voters during the ABC presidential debate. It was the first time the two candidates had met face-to-face. Here are some of the key lines from their onstage encounter: In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump repeated a familiar claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.  “We wouldn’t have left $85 billion worth of brand new, beautiful military equipment behind,” Trump said.  As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure — it’s closer to $83 billion — for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A fraction of this funding was for equipment.  Donald Trump’s campaign tried to claim victory before the end of the presidential debate Tuesday, with top Trump advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles arguing that his performance was “masterful” and that he laid out a “bold vision of America.” The statement called Vice President Kamala Harris’ vision for America “a dark reminder of the oppressive, big government policies of Joe Biden that she wants to continue.” Speaking during her closing remarks, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a familiar line for anybody who’s listened to her truncated campaign: “We are not going back.” She said America on Tuesday night has heard “two very different visions for our country: One that is focused on the future, and one that is focused on the past — an attempt to take us backward.” “But we’re not going back,” she added. Harris added: “And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us — and we can chart a new way forward.” This post has been updated with additional remarks from Kamala Harris. Donald Trump’s big question for Kamala Harris during his closing remarks during the presidential debate Tuesday, was: “Why didn’t she do it?” as he tried to tie the vice president to the Biden administration. He looked to make his case against Harris by connecting her to “wars going on in the Middle East. We have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine,” the Biden administration’s chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and immigration. He also said Harris would ban fracking, a position she has since reversed her position on after saying in 2019 that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.”   He ended his remarks by calling President Joe Biden and Harris “the worst president, the worst vice president in the history of our country.” This post has been updated with additional remarks from Trump. Former President Donald Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris met with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Russia invaded Ukraine and failed to deter him from the invasion.  Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris was not sent to negotiate peace, and she has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference.  The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.”  CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.   Roughly 90 minutes into the debate broadcast, former President Donald Trump had spoken for about 40 minutes and 50 seconds, while Vice President Kamala Harris used roughly 35 minutes and 31 seconds. While the debate is designed to offer both candidates an equal chance to respond to questions, they can choose not to use the maximum allotted time. The moderators have also allowed more time for responses after some exchanges. Follow our live graphic to see who’s using the most and least airtime as the debate concludes (data will be updated every 5 seconds). Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.   Facts First: This claim is false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. Capitol security is overseen by the Capitol Police Board, a body that includes the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate. Pelosi’s office has explicitly said she was not presented with an offer of 10,000 National Guardsmen as Trump has claimed, telling CNN last year that claims to the contrary are “lies.” And even if Pelosi had been told of an offer of National Guard troops, she would not have had the power to turn it down. The speaker of the House has no authority to prevent the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president (whose authority was delegated, under a decades-old executive order, to the Secretary of the Army).  You can read a complete fact check on it here. Former President Donald Trump repeated a version of one of his frequent claims Tuesday night that legal scholars wanted Roe v. Wade overturned so individual states could instead decide how to regulate abortion.  Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Many legal scholars wanted the right to have an abortion preserved in federal law, as several told CNN when Trump made a similar claim in April.  Some legal scholars who support abortion rights had wanted Roe written in a different way, including even the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but that isn’t the same as saying that “every legal scholar” believed Roe should be overturned and sent to the states.   “Donald Trump’s claim is flatly incorrect,” another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university’s Health Law and Policy Program, said in April.  Trump’s claim is “obviously not” true, said Mary Ziegler, alaw professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: “Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn’t want to overturn Roe … It wasn’t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.”  Read more here.  Pressed about whether he had a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, former President Donald Trump’s answer was vague. “I have concepts of a plan,” Trump said during the presidential debate Tuesday night. “But I’m not president right now,” he added. Some background: Trump in November promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republican senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill. Donald Trump again looked to tie Kamala Harris to some of the Biden administration unpopular policies during the presidential debate Thursday, claiming the vice president “is Biden.” “Remember this she is Biden. You know, she’s trying to get away from Biden. ‘I don’t know the gentleman,’ she says. She is Biden,” Trump said. He called Joe Biden’s presidency “the most divisive presidency in the history of our country.” Harris, while laughing and gesturing to herself, said, “clearly, I am not Joe Biden and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.” Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday that both she and her running mate Tim Walz own guns. Harris currently owns a handgun, an aide told CNN. Some context: In 2019, when she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination, Harris spoke of owning a firearm. “I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do – for personal safety,” she told reporters in Iowa. “I was a career prosecutor.” Back in California, Harris served as an Alameda County criminal prosecutor, San Francisco district attorney and state attorney general. A Harris campaign aide said at the time that the weapon was a handgun, which she keeps locked up as a responsible gun owner. According to the aide, the handgun was purchased years earlier. But in terms of gun reform, Harris has made impassioned calls for banning assault weapons and universal background checks. CNN’s Kyung Lah and MJ Lee contributed reporting. Former President Donald Trump claimed at Tuesday’s debate that Vice President Kamala Harris has been the Biden administration’s “border czar.”  Facts First: Trump’s claim about Harris’ border role is false. Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.  Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries.  Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries. (Biden also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.”  Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far.  During a back-and-forth over the war in Ukraine, former President Donald Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris failed to secure peace after being sent to negotiate with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia. When moderator David Muir asked Harris directly whether she had met Russian President Vladimir Putin, Harris responded: “I said at the beginning of this debate, you’re gonna hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella. And that is another one.” Harris said she’s met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky several times. Vice President Kamala Harris’ health care platform builds on the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce prescription drug costs. She is calling to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. These caps were put in place for those on Medicare in the Inflation Reduction Act. The $2,000 limit on Medicare Part D drug costs takes effect in January. Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration announced the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in $6 billion in savings for Medicare and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices take effect in 2026. Meanwhile, Trump in November promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republican senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill. Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president’s pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden. In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for. The former president also praised medical marijuana ahead of some states voting on the issue this fall. Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Some of former President Donald Trump’s allies tell CNN they are frustrated that he has lost his composure multiple times during tonight’s debate. These allies said that they don’t believe Vice President Kamala Harris is answering questions directly, but that her answers are overshadowed by Trump’s inability to stay on message. Trump’s allies had been warning the former president against responding to goading remarks from Harris. While those close to him indicated he understood the importance of this, Trump multiple times has taken bait from Harris, including fighting with her over whether people leave his rallies early. Trump’s team and aligned Republicans have begun blaming the moderators, criticizing them for fact-checking Trump and not Harris and claiming they are giving Harris softer questions — a sign his allies do not see the former president as “winning” this debate. The Harris campaign’s strategy leading up to Tuesday’s debate — and during — was to get former President Donald Trump off message. And the vice president’s aides and allies applauded the moments when her goading appeared to work; the preparation, they said, was going to plan.  Within the first hour of the debate, multiple aides and allies gushed over her performance. One Democratic lawmaker offered a more tempered reaction.  “She is doing okay. Solid but still a little uneven and missing some opportunities. But Trump is a complete disaster, and she is playing him very well. He is in full on crazy town,” the lawmaker told CNN.   When asked about previous false comments he’s made on Kamala Harris “happened to turn Black” for political purposes, former President Donald Trump said he “couldn’t care less” about her race.   Harris called Trump’s comments about her race a “tragedy.”  Harris went on to attack the former president’s record on race relations in America, referring to a housing discrimination lawsuit his development company faced in the 1970s for denying housing to Black Americans, and the birther conspiracy Trump started around former President Barack Obama’s nationality.   Vice President Kamala Harris said she agreed with President Joe Biden’s controversial decision to pull US troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. Harris then went on to criticize Trump’s handling of international relations, saying that he “negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine” on the matter during his time as president.  “He bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban,” she said.  The vice president then accused Trump of inviting the Taliban to Camp David — the historic presidential residence in Maryland. “This former president, as president invited them to Camp David because he does not, again, appreciate the role and responsibility of the president of the United States, to be commander in chief with a level of respect,” Harris said. This post has been updated with additional remarks from Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign is teasing an undisclosed guest to appear in the spin room following the debate to serve as a surrogate for Vice President Harris. A roster of Democratic governors and lawmakers are expected to magnify Vice President Kamala Harris’s performance in the spin room following tonight’s debate. Earlier in the day, former Trump administration officials Olivia Troye and Anthony Scaramucci spoke out against the reelection of their former boss. Asked who the special guest will be, a campaign official said it was “TBA,” or to be announced.   In the first hour of Tuesday’s presidential debate, 71% of grassroots donors to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign were women, a campaign official told CNN. The first hour of the debate featured heated exchanges between Harris and former President Donald Trump around abortion access and reproductive health care. Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Tuesday that 818,000 of the jobs the Biden-Harris administration created from April 2023 to March 2024 were a “fraud.” Trump was referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ recently released preliminary estimate for its annual benchmark revision that suggested there were 818,000 fewer jobs for the year ended in March 2024 than were initially reported. Economic data is often revised, especially as more comprehensive information becomes available, to provide a clearer, more accurate, picture of the dynamics at play. Every year – including the four years when Trump was president – the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a thorough review of the survey-based employment estimates from the monthly jobs report and reconciles those estimates with fuller employment counts measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program. This annual process, called a benchmarking, provides a near-complete employment count, because the BLS can correct for sampling and modeling errors from the surveys and re-anchor those estimates to unemployment insurance tax records. The revision process is two-fold: A preliminary estimate is released in mid-August, and the final revision is issued in February, alongside the January jobs report. While the recently announced preliminary revision (which amounts to 0.5% of total employment) was the largest downward revision since 2009 (which was -902,000, or -0.7%), there have been other large revisions made in recent years – notably a downward revision of 514,000 jobs (-0.3%) for the year ended in March 2019, during the Trump administration.  Former President Donald Trump said the US experienced “the highest inflation” ever under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.  Facts First: Trump’s claim that inflation was at its highest under the Biden-Harris administration is false. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, hit 9.1% in June 2022. That wasn’t the highest ever recorded. Rather, it was the highest inflation rate in nearly forty years. For instance, in 1980, inflation hit nearly 15%, according to CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   Some of the earliest inflation data the BLS maintains indicates that inflation was even higher in 1917, when it was trending at nearly 18%. During Tuesday night’s debate, Vice President Kamala Harris said: Facts First: This is misleading. Harris did not make her position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence; Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate.  Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president. Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.”  It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time, given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Thursday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior.  Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States took in billions of dollars from China as a result of his tariffs.   Facts First: Trump’s claim about how tariffs work is false. A US tariff is paid by importing businesses in the United States – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border.   Here’s how tariffs work:When the United States puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer.  Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.  It’s true that the US Treasury has collected more than $242 billion from the tariffs Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods – but those duties were paid by US importers, not the country of China.   Former President Donald Trump claimed that when Vice President Kamala Harris previously ran for the presidency, during the 2020 election cycle, she was the very first candidate to drop out of a crowded Democratic primary.  “When she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed,” Trump claimed, referring to Harris’ 2020 bid, while arguing that Harris didn’t receive any votes this primary cycle because President Joe Biden was still at top of the ticket during the primaries.  Facts First: This is false. Harris was far from the first candidate to drop out of that Democratic primary when she exited the race in early December 2019. She was preceded by the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City; andsitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate, plus some others  Former President Donald Trump repeated a false claim at Tuesday’s debate that has been promoted by numerous prominent Republicans in the past week, including Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance. Trump claimed that Haitian migrants in the city of Springfield, Ohio, are stealing people’s pet dogs and cats and eating them.  Facts First: This is false. The City of Springfield and the local police have said they have seen no evidence for the claim – which appeared to originate from a Facebook post in which someone purporting to be a local resident passed along what they said was a story about their neighbor’s daughter’s friend.  The Springfield News-Sun reported that “the Springfield Police Division said Monday morning they have received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten.”  Vance acknowledged on social media on Tuesday that it is “possible” that the “rumors” he has heard from local residents “will turn out to be false,” though he also encouraged people to “keep the cat memes flowing.”  Kamala Harris looked to separate herself from Joe Biden on the debate stage Tuesday when Donald Trump tried to link her to the president’s policies. “Biden had no idea how to talk to [Russian leader Vladimir Putin]. He had no idea how to stop it, and now you have millions of people dead, and it’s only getting worse,” Trump said of the ongoing conflict. “Where is our president? We don’t even know if he’s our president. They threw him out of the campaign like a dog,” Trump added. Biden ended his campaign for reelection in July and endorsed Harris. A little over half an hour into Tuesday night’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Harris campaign officials and Democrats are delighted by what they see as the vice president successfully baiting the former president. So far, no other exchange has pleased Harris aides more than when the vice president commented on Trump supporters “leaving his rallies early” – which prompted the former president, who is famously sensitive about his crowd sizes – to insist on pushing back on the allegation. “He is taking the bait at every turn,” a Harris campaign aide said. “So triggered,” said another. A Democratic congressman watching told CNN: “Man, she got right under his skin. Took bait.” Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Donald Trump would “essentially be immune from any misconduct” undertaken by him while in the White House.  Facts First: This needs context. In their decision in July in the historic case, the six conservative justices granted Trump some presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, but not blanket immunity, as the former president had sought in his federal election subversion case. The court said Trump could not be criminally pursued over “official acts,” but that he could face prosecution over alleged criminal actions involving “unofficial acts” taken while in office.   Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are facing off in their first debate Tuesday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The debate comes less than two months before Election Day. See more photos from the debate Former President Donald Trump argued that he could get Russia’s war in Ukraine “settled” within 24 hours if he’s elected back into office. Asked by moderator David Muir how he would end the war and if he wants Ukraine to win war, Trump responded: “I want the war to stop… people being killed by the millions,” adding that he believes the Biden administration has not asked NATO to invest more in the war. Trump went on to say that he has a good relationship with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I will get it settled even before I become president,” he said. When asked to clarify his stance on whether it’s in the US’ best interest for Ukraine to win the war, Trump said: Kamala Harris on Tuesday attempted to tie the January 6 attack on the US Capitol to Donald Trump’s past rhetoric after the former president appeared to downplay his role in the riot. “Let’s remember Charlottesville,” she said, referring to the White nationalists, neo-Nazis and other right-wing groups who descended on the Virginia city in 2017 to protest its decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, with some chanting, “Jews will not replace us.” One of the attendees rammed his car into a crowd, killing a 32-year-old paralegal and injuring several others. Trump was widely condemned at the time for declaring that there were “very fine people” on both sides of the demonstrations. “Let’s remember that when it came to the Proud Boys, a militia, the former president said, ‘Stand back and stand by,’” Harris added, referring to a remark Trump made at a 2020 presidential debate. Asked to condemn White supremacists, Trump instead used his allotted time to blame what he called “antifa and the left” for violence and to tell the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.” “Let’s turn the page on this. Let’s not go back. Let’s chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past,” Harris said. When contrasting her stance on abortion with that of former President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris claimed that Trump would sign a national abortion ban if he’s elected and that under Project 2025, which she alleged was authored by Trump, abortions and miscarriages would be monitored.   Facts First: Harris is making a prediction that we cannot definitively fact check, but Trump himself has not, during this campaign, endorsed these policies she said he would implement as president.  Trump has repeatedly ducked direct questions about his support for a federal ban, and polls show that a majority of Americans are not in favor of a federal abortion ban.  Additionally, there is no evidence that Trump was personally involved in writing the Project 2025 policy document. Noah Weinrich, a spokesperson for Project 2025, said in a message to CNN when a similar claim was made during the Democratic National Convention last month: “Project 2025 is not affiliated with any candidate, and no candidate was involved with the drafting of the Mandate for Leadership, which was published by Heritage in April 2023.”  At the first break, former President Donald Trump clocked in at approximately 28 minutes, 22 seconds, while Vice President Kamala Harris’ time came in at approximately 21 minutes, 25 seconds.  Follow our live graphic to see who’s getting the most and least airtime as the debate continues. While both candidates have an equal chance to respond to questions, they can choose not to use the maximum allotted time. Data will be updated every 5 seconds. Despite his running mate JD Vance saying that Donald Trump would veto a national abortion ban, the former president said tonight he did not discuss it with him.  On the debate stage, Trump said he is “not a fan” of an abortion ban, but would not explicitly say if he would veto one — rather that it would never get through Congress.  Last month, Vance told “Meet the Press” that Trump would veto a national abortion ban if it hit his desk as president. “I think it’d be very clear he would not support it,” Vance said. “I mean, if you’re not supporting it, as the President of the United States, you fundamentally have to veto it.”  Pressed again, Vance said, “I think he would, he said that explicitly that he would.” In April, Trump said he would not sign a federal abortion ban if it passed Congress, but he didn’t explicitly say he would veto one. Former President Donald Trump backtracked on statements in which he seemingly agreed that he lost the 2020 election by “a whisker” and claimed he was being “sarcastic.” “I said that?” Trump said as moderator David Muir read back Trump’s own statements on the 2020 election. “That was said sarcastically.” “Look, there’s so much proof. All you have to do is look at it, they should’ve sent it back to the legislatures for approval,” Trump said. Vice President Kamala Harris later pushed back against the former president’s claims on the 2020 election, saying, “Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people, so let’s be clear about that, and clearly he’s having a very difficult time processing that.” This post has been updated with Kamala Harris’ remarks. Vice President Kamala Harris said that “world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump” during the presidential debate on Tuesday. Harris argued Trump does not have the “temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact,” pointing to his denial over his 2020 election loss and his claims about the court cases against him being a weaponization of the Justice Department. Responding to Harris’ answer, Trump praised the prime minister of Hungary, calling Viktor Orbán “one of the most respected men” and a “tough person.” Trump claimed Orbán said, “You Trump back as president, they were afraid of him.” Trump said that referred to countries such as China and Russia. “Look, Viktor Orbán said it. He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump,” he added, claiming there were “no problems” when he was president. The Hungarian prime minister first won power through a democratic election, then proceeded to weaken the institutions of that democracy by eroding the legal system, firing civil servants, politicizing business, attacking the press and intimidating opposition parties and demagoguing migration. This post has been updated with additional remarks from Donald Trump. Take a look at the positions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country that has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began last October. Harris: After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed Joe Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, as well as the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.” However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” and said, “I will not be silent.” The vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August. Harris said that as president, she would maintain the US alliance with Israel and “ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.”  Trump: The former president also met with Netanyahu in July, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict. In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.” Many Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must “finish what they started,” “get it over with fast,” and that the US must “let Israel finish the job.” Read more about the candidates and where they stand on key issues. Former President Donald Trump claimed during Tuesday night’s debate that “21 million people” are crossing the border monthly into the United States under President Joe Biden.  Facts First: This number is false. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern borders from February 2021 through July 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was roughly 10 million, far less than Trump’s “21 million” figure.   An “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. Even if you added the estimated number of “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans have said is more than 1.7 million during the Biden-Harris administration, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in an email in June, when Trump made similar claims.  Former President Donald Trump blamed former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser for the lack of security during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. But the speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. That’s the responsibility of the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the US Capitol Police and approves requests for National Guard assistance. Trump also repeated Tuesday night that he requested 10,000 National Guard members ahead of January 6, but that “Nancy Pelosi rejected me.” However, Trump’s former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller has told lawmakers that he was never given a formal order by Trump to have 10,000 troops ready to be sent to the Capitol on January 6. When asked by ABC News’ David Muir whether there was anything he regretted about what he did that day as president, Trump said he told rioters to protest “peacefully and patriotically” during a speech he made on January 6.  He then deflected the question, asking “what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people that [Vice President Kamala Harris] allowed to pour in?”  The former president called Harris “the border czar” — a frequent name he calls the vice president to attack her stance on immigration.  CNN’s Zachary Cohen contributed reporting. This post has been updated with additional information. Former President Donald Trump claimed that he “probably took a bullet to the head” because of the rhetoric Vice President Kamala Harris and others have said about him — referring to the July assassination attempt on him. Trump was pushing back against Harris’ claim that the former president would weaponize the Justice Department against his political enemies if reelected. Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated that her “values have not changed” when asked about her previous stance that she would ban fracking and took a jab at former President Donald Trump’s character. “I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States. And in fact, I was the tie breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking,” she said. Harris said she wants to invest in “diverse sources of energy.” During her 2020 campaign, she enthusiastically supported a ban on fracking — but a Harris campaign official said in late July that she no longer supports such a ban. Previously, Harris acknowledged that it would take legislation to restrict fracking beyond federal lands, and pointed to the residual health impacts of fracking on local communities. She said during a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, she said she would start “with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands.” Harris later took a jab at former President Trump’s character by talking about her upbringing and being raised by a single mother and her career fighting for people who need help as a prosecutor. “The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down it’s in lifting people up,” Harris said. When Trump responded, he started talking about more of Harris’ previous stances — eliciting a reaction from Harris at the other podium. Vice President Kamala Harris previewed a new line of attack against former President Donald Trump in the first minutes of Tuesday night’s debate, with the frame “What Donald Trump left us.” It was an intentional move by the campaign to introduce that message at the debate. “What Trump Left Us was a big moment,” a Harris campaign official told CNN. “She just nailed his record in less than a minute. He was defensive. Good.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is watching tonight’s presidential debate backstage at a campaign watch party in Phoenix, Arizona, a campaign official told pool reporters traveling with Walz. Walz addressed the watch party in Phoenix prior to the debate, where he said former President Donald Trump will have to “answer for the absolute trainwreck that was his presidency” during tonight’s presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. ABC News’ moderators, Linsey Davis and David Muir, have been fact-checking former President Donald Trump live as they host Tuesday’s debate. After Trump said Kamala Harris supports “execution after birth,” Davis responded by saying: “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.” When Trump said crime rates have skyrocketed under President Joe Biden and Harris, Muir countered by saying: “President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is actually coming down in this country.” A big question heading into tonight’s debate was whether Kamala Harris and Donald Trump would shake hands.  The vice president’s team had declined to entertain questions before the debate about whether Harris intended to try to shake Trump’s hand. A senior adviser now confirms the vice president went into tonight with the plan to do so, which is why she ended up walking to Trump’s podium to extend her hand out first. He accepted the handshake. Harris introduced herself by name and said, “Let’s have a good debate.” Trump responded: “Nice to see you. Have fun.” Trump and President Joe Biden did not shake hands at the beginning of the CNN debate in June.   Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated a claim that migrants are arriving to the US after fleeing prisons and mental institutions.   “We have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums,” Trump claimed.   Trump makes this claim often, and he’s often alleged that jails and mental institutions are being emptied out deliberately to somehow dump people upon the US.   Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim.   Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN last year they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing.  Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.  In response to CNN’s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes – a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated.  And a second article that Cheung cited at the time, about Mexico’s president having freed 2,685 prisoners, was not about migration at all; that article simply explained that the president had freed them “as part of an effort to free those who have not committed serious crimes or were being held unjustly.”  Kamala Harris hit Donald Trump over his lack of support from people who once worked for him, listing off former officials who have decried their former boss as the former president rebutted that the Biden administration should be firing more of their officials. She listed off several former Trump administration officials who have come out against Trump, including his second chief of staff, John Kelly, who said the former president has “contempt” for the Constitution. Trump hit back by saying: “I’m a different kind of a person. I fired most of those people, not so graciously. They did bad things or a bad job. I fired them.” He added the Biden administration “never fired one person.” He said the Democratic administration should have fired those “having to do with Afghanistan,” referring to the deadly August 2021 US withdrawal from the country. Trump added, “look at the economy. Look at the inflation. They didn’t fire any of their economists.” Vice President Kamala Harris invited people to attend one of former President Donald Trump’s rallies because “it’s a really interesting thing to watch.” She said that she believes the American people deserve a president who puts them first and Harris pledged to be that president. Trump responded by saying: “People don’t go to her rallies. There’s no reason to go.” He said people don’t leave his rallies, which he described as “the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies, in the history of politics.” This post has been updated with more remarks from the candidates. Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that there was virtually no inflation during his administration.  “I had no inflation, virtually no inflation,” Trump said.  Inflation was low at the end of Trump’s term, having plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The year-over-year inflation rate was about 1.4% in January 2021, the month Trump left office.   Former Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that former President Donald Trump’s policies would result in a “Trump sales tax” that would raise prices for middle class families by about $4,000 a year.    Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House.  Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.   Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund a liberal think tank.  If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP.  Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households.  ABC’s rules for tonight’s presidential debate stipulated that the other candidate’s microphone would be muted while their opponent is speaking — but crosstalk between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump was clearly audible during one of their exchanges. Trump was giving an answer on his stance on in vitro fertilization. He told the moderators to ask whether Harris would support abortion in the eighth or ninth month. Harris was clearly heard responding, “Oh, c’mon.” Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record during her campaign and outlined her policies. Trump’s attacks stem from President Joe Biden having tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security. Here’s a look at what both candidates have proposed on the issue: Trump Harris Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s stances on key issues. Vice President Kamala Harris said former President Donald Trump’s proposal to institute sweeping tariffs on all imports of up to 20% is “a tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month.” What Harris failed to mention though is that under her watch, President Joe Biden has instituted hefty tariffs, predominantly on Chinese imports. In May, the administration implemented new tariff rates on Chinese imports – ranging from 100% on electric vehicles to 50% for solar components to 25% for other sectors – that will roll out over the next two years. Harris sought to defend such tariffs by saying Trump “invited trade wars.” Former President Donald Trump said that he would not sign a national abortion ban. Trump, pushing back against Vice President Kamala Harris’ claim that the former president would push through a national abortion ban, said, “Well there she goes again, it’s a lie. I’m not signing a ban and there’s no reason to sign a ban because we’ve gotten what everybody wanted” — referring to the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade. Vice President Kamala Harris criticized what she called “Trump abortion bans” in an impassioned argument for reproductive rights during Tuesday night’s debate. She said Trump’s policies on abortion have no exception for rape or incest, which she called “immoral.” Harris also pointed out Trump’s selection of US Supreme Court Justices during his time as president, which she linked to the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  “Let’s understand how we got here,” she said.  Harris then went on to say she would “proudly” sign a bill into law reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade if elected president. What Trump has said about abortion: Trump’s position on abortion is that “states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” according to an April video posted to his Truth Social platform. That stance was echoed in the new Republican National Committee platform. The platform does not mention a national abortion ban, a policy some social conservatives wanted to see included, but which the former president has publicly said he opposes.  The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade remains unpopular with a wide majority of Americans, according to a poll from Marquette Law School released last month, with two-thirds opposing the decision.  Vice President Kamala Harris appeared incredulous during former President Donald Trump’s answers on China during Tuesday’s presidential debate — raising her eyebrows, lowering her chin and mouthing “that’s not true” to his answer. After Trump said China “bought their chips from Taiwan,” Harris held her mouth agape and shook her head. She continued shaking her head as Trump said she’s adopted some of his policies. When Trump called her a “Marxist,” Harris raised her eyebrows and tilted her head back. When Trump referred to Harris’ father as a Marxist, Harris brought her hand to her chin to pantomime contemplative thought. Harris’ campaign pushed to have the mics unmuted during the debate but was unsuccessful. Vice President Kamala Harris said mainstream economists believe her economic plan would grow the economy and Donald Trump’s would shrink it. Goldman Sachs, in an analyst note last week, said exactly that: Trump’s economic policies — particularly on trade — would cause America’s economy to shrink by a bit in 2025. By contrast, Harris’ economic policy proposals would grow the economy by a marginal amount next year, Goldman Sachs predicted. Trump has proposed 10% to 20% tariffs on most items imported to the United States except Chinese goods — which would get a 60% tariff. That would cost Americans $2,600 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. And Trump’s proposal to deport 10 million to 20 million immigrants would be an “inflation shock.” Even a tenth of that proposal would lift inflation by 1.3 percentage points after three years, according to research presented at the Peterson Institute for International Economics by Australian economist Warwick McKibbin. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, would be 2.1 percentage points lower with that many deportations — a dramatic decrease. Harris’ proposals, by contrast, are more standard fare and would keep the economy on pace, most mainstream economists say. Former President Donald Trump defended his decision to support the six-week abortion ban that will be on the ballot in his home state of Florida, a change from his previous stance on the measure. He said “Democrats are radical” in their abortion policies, though he has said he believes abortion should be a state issue. Trump also went on to tout that he was able to overturn Roe v. Wade by appointing justices to the Supreme Court and said that he still believes in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. This November, voters in at least 10 states will take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, after a nationwide effort by organizers to secure a wave of ballot measures aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion — and some aimed at restricting it. Trump also attacked Kamala Harris’ vice presidential pick, Tim Walz, for his stance on abortion, claiming that Walz supports “execution after birth.” ABC News Live anchor Linsey Davis pushed back on that claim, saying: “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.” What Trump has said about abortion: Trump’s position on abortion is that “states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” according to an April video posted to his Truth Social platform. That stance was echoed in the new Republican National Committee platform. The platform does not mention a national abortion ban, a policy some social conservatives wanted to see included, but which the former president has publicly said he opposes.  The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade remains unpopular with a wide majority of Americans, according to a poll from Marquette Law School released last month, with two-thirds opposing the decision. This post has been updated with additional comments from Donald Trump. The candidates are being asked about abortion and reproductive rights, a key issue in the 2024 campaign. Here’s a look at where each candidate stands on the issue. Kamala Harris’ stance: Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the Biden administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. This past January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic. On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions. Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger. The issue was a key part of the programming at the Democratic National Convention this summer and Harris’ campaign announced the launch of a 50-stop bus tour last month — starting in Trump’s backyard of Palm Beach, Florida — focused on reproductive health care. Donald Trump’s stance: Trump last month said he will not support a ballot referendum to expand abortion access in his home state of Florida just 24 hours after suggesting he might. The rush to clarify his stance followed intense blowback from anti-abortion advocates online, leading to concerns among Republicans that Trump’s continued waffling on abortion might lose him some deeply religious voters in a tightening race. Trump, whose ever-evolving views on reproductive health have traversed every side of the debate, has long expressed concerns about the political fallout from the 2022 Supreme Court decision to end the constitutional right to an abortion. Though he has sought credit for installing the three conservative justices that tipped the court to overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump earlier this year said future questions about access should be left to the states. Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban and has taken the position that abortion laws should be decided by states. He’s also said that he supports exceptions in cases of rape and incest and when the life of the mother is under threat. Trump said in May that he did not support banning birth control. He previously said that he was “looking at” contraceptives when asked if he supported restrictions. In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for. Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a “Marxist” on Tuesday as he looked to tie the vice president to her father, a retired Stanford University economist. “If she ever got elected, she’d change it. And it will be the end of our country. She’s a Marxist; everybody knows she’s a Marxist. Her father is a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well,” Trump said during the presidential debate. Some background: The former president has previously levied similar personal attacks against Harris and focused on her father, Donald Harris, who rose from a rural boyhood to earn a doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, and became the first Black economics professor granted tenure at Stanford. Among the economists who know him, Harris’ father is considered a free thinker, willing to challenge his field’s orthodoxy, CNN previously reported. He has largely stayed out of the public eye during his daughter’s political rise, though he did emerge publicly during Harris’ 2020 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination to publicly chastise her for joking that of course she had smoked marijuana, given her Jamaican background. This post has been updated with additional information. Former President Donald Trump distanced himself from Project 2025 after Vice President Kamala Harris accused him of being linked to the “dangerous plan.” “I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” he said. “That’s out there. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it, purposely. I’m not going to read it.” Trump went on to say that the people who wrote the Project 2025 plan came up with ideas, “I guess some good, some bad,” but that it makes no difference because he has nothing to do it with it. Some background: Harris has been attacking parts of the conservative Project 2025 that sets up a blueprint for a potential second Donald Trump presidency. The 920-page document was organized by the Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration. Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.”   Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism. A Harris campaign official previously said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.”  This post has been updated with additional remarks from Donald Trump. Democrats have been attacking parts of the conservative Project 2025 that sets up a blueprint for a potential second Donald Trump presidency. The 920-page document was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration. Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.”   But, Russell Vought, one of the key authors of Project 2025, was heard on video talking candidly about his behind-the-scenes work to prepare policy for Trump, his expansive views on presidential power, his plans to restrict pornography and immigration, and his complaints that the GOP was too focused on “religious liberty” instead of “Christian nation-ism.” Vought thought the men he was talking to were relatives of a wealthy conservative donor. They actually worked for a British journalism nonprofit and were secretly recording him the entire time. Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism. A Harris campaign official previously said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.” Vice President Kamala Harris said the Biden administration had to “clean up Donald Trump’s mess” after his four years in the White House. She accused Trump of leaving the US with “the worst unemployment since the Great Depression,” “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War,” and “the worst public health epidemic in a century.” “What we have done, and what I intend to do, is build on what we know are the aspirations and the hopes of the American people,” she said.  Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized that she has a plan to help American families who say they are worried about the economy and cost of living. “I believe in the ambition, the aspiration, the dreams of the American people,” she said. She touted her plans to build an “opportunity economy,” including her proposals to make housing more affordable and expand the child tax credit. Harris also attacked former President Donald Trump’s proposals, such as providing tax cuts to corporations and argued that they would hurt American middle class families. Trump has promised to extend the cuts from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, notably the TCJA’s individual income tax breaks, and reduce the corporate tax rate. Trump responded by repeating his claim that he would put tariffs on other countries, such as China. He also pointed out that President Joe Biden kept those tariffs in place. The former president also emphasized the high inflation rates under the Biden-Harris administration, saying they have been a “disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class.” Read more about Harris’ plans here and Trump’s plans here  This post has been updated with additional remarks from Donald Trump. High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. In new CNN polling of six swing states, economic issues remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters in their choice for president. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump both unveiled more of their economic plans last week. Below is a snapshot of what the candidates have proposed so far. Highlights of Harris’ economic promises Highlights of Trump’s economic promises: Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump shook hands when they met for the debate Tuesday night. Harris walked over to Trump and extended her hand. He accepted the handshake. Harris introduced herself by name and said, “Let’s have a good debate.” Trump responded: “Nice to see you. Have fun.” It’s the first time Harris and Trump have ever met in person. ABC News officially announced the rules last week of tonight’s presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. The moderators are going over the rules now as the debate kicks off. Here are some of the key rules of the face off: We’re tracking how much speaking time each candidate uses during the first presidential debate meeting between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Follow our live graphic to see who uses the most and least airtime. Data will be updated every 5 seconds. The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is underway in Philadelphia. The debate, hosted by ABC News and moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, comes as the latest polls show the race for the White House remains tight. How to watch: More on the debate: ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden, during which the candidates’ microphones were muted as their opponent spoke. It was a rule that the Biden campaign had insisted on but something the Harris campaign had sought to change after she became a presidential candidate. The network’s rules also state that there will be no audience, the candidates will not be permitted to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two commercial breaks and the candidates cannot ask questions of one another. Former President Donald Trump’s team has enlisted some of the most vocal and popular right wing social media activists to assist with rapid response during the debate. Rogan O’Handley, Jack Posobiec, Alex Bruesewitz and Chaya Raichik among others have set up what they are calling a “social media war room” to respond in real-time to the debate. Trump facetimed into the so-called war room tonight, according to sources in the room. Their collective social media accounts are expected to reach millions, though most of them are conservative followers. Trump’s campaign has made an effort to reach out to these influencers for months to court them as they try to reach conservative voters who may not engage with politics in a traditional way ahead of November. California Gov. Gavin Newsom says Vice President Kamala Harris should work to defend President Joe Biden’s record during the debate Tuesday night – but still find ways to set herself apart from the president. Asked why the race was so close, Newsom said “We’re a divided country and we have work to do.” Inflation is also a contributor, he said. One of the first Democratic lawmakers to call for President Joe Biden to drop out of the race after the June presidential debate said he feels more confident going into tonight’s debate. Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat of Washington, was among the first to voice opposition to Biden remaining the Democratic presidential candidate after his poor debate performance in June — a debate that ultimately changed the trajectory of the race when Biden dropped out weeks later. Smith feels differently Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris’ motorcade is rolling into the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia for tonight’s debate. It arrived at the debate site at 8:17 p.m. ET. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff wished his wife good luck at the presidential debate tonight. He said he can’t wait to see Vice President Kamala Harris “in action” on the stage against former President Donald Trump. “You’ve got this, and I’ve got you,” Emhoff said in a post on X. Kamala Harris’ debate team has been preparing the vice president for some of Donald Trump’s most popular lines of attack: going after her immigration record and the Biden administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, according to two sources familiar.  The Trump campaign previewed as much on Monday, pointing to border security — which remains a political vulnerability for the vice president — and the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as issues that the Trump camp believes Harris “owns” and that Trump will pursue on the debate stage.  Presented with that, Harris aides and allies expect Harris to paint Trump as “unserious” and have prepared the vice president to describe, what they say, are the former president’s “unpopular policies,” instead of taking the bait.  That’s especially true when it comes to Trump falsely claiming that Harris is the “border czar” who is solely responsible for the management of the US-Mexico border. It’s a title that Harris team has been trying to shake off since the moment President Joe Biden assigned her to tackle root causes of migration in 2021.  But this time,Harris campaign officials think she has a case on immigration: using the failed bipartisan border measure to cast Trump as unserious at the border and citing her time as California attorney general tackling transnational criminal gangs.  Similarly, her team has prepared Harris to use Trump’s own actions and record against him, in an attempt to flip the script on the former president on issues, like the withdrawal from Afghanistan.  Some undecided voters in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania say they are going to be closely watching the debate tonight between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. One voter who is participating in a CNN focus group at Mercyhurst University in Erie said she wants to hear more about where both candidates stand on the economy. She said as a grandmother, the economy will be a key issue for her this election, specifically housing affordability, the cost of living and jobs. “There’s just so many things I worry about for my children and my grandchildren,” the voter said. When asked to raise their hand if they thought the debate will determine how they vote in November, nearly all of the people in the group put their hands up. Nearly all of the voters also put their hands up when asked if they felt like they needed to learn more about Harris after she became the Democratic nominee just a few months ago. The voters will also share their reactions after the debate. Will either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump deliver a compelling message in tonight’s debate to swing voters while bolstering the confidence of their respective bases? Here’s what to watch out for as the candidates take the stage: Will Harris deliver a policy message? Harris has been vice president for nearly four years. Still, 28% of likely voters in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll said they needed to know more about her. The debate will provide a platform for Harris to address that. She has drilled down on two issues: cost of living and reproductive rights. The latter is an obvious place of strength. Her position is vastly more popular than Trump’s and her ability to speak about it is significantly stronger than Biden’s. It also fits neatly into a broader message about personal freedoms. The economy is a stickier wicket. Her campaign has sought to stay close to what the Biden administration has been preaching while injecting it with a populist freshness. And while there’s little reason to expect Harris to deviate from her strategy, which has been to speak broadly while rationing specifics, she will be pushed to provide a clearer picture of how she ranks her priorities. Harris is also likely to be pressed on some recent policy switcharoos. Trump to face cross-examination on abortion Trump has at times boasted of appointing three of the six Supreme Court Justices who voted in 2022 to gut Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion. “I’m proud to have done it,” he once proclaimed. The former president himself has offered a variety of positions and takes on the issue, the most consistent being that abortion policy should be determined by the states. Asked what state policies he supports, Trump has failed to deliver a clear answer. How does Harris address the war in Gaza? Because of the diverse, fragile Democratic coalition that she needs to keep onside, Harris has not been fully clear on her Middle East plan. Both in her convention speech and on the newly minted “issues” page on her campaign website, Harris has made the case for Israel’s defense, along with the creation of a neighboring Palestinian state, and security for both. Critics say she is cutting the proverbial baby in half. Here’s what else to watch out for ahead of tonight’s debate. Vice President Kamala Harris spent the day reviewing issues and themes as well as possible debate scenarios with her team, according to a source a familiar. Her aides and allies tell CNN she’s ready and feeling prepared. Earlier today, President Joe Biden told reporters he spoke with Harris who he described as appearing “calm, cool, and collected.” Read about Harris’ and Trump’s stances on key issues. Thursday night’s debate is taking place in Philadelphia, putting a spotlight on the top media market in the top battleground state this election. Since President Joe Biden dropped out, both sides have poured ad money into the critical battleground, totaling more than $161.7 million between July 22 and September 10. And the campaigns and their allies have run close on Pennsylvania airwaves during that stretch – Democrats have spent about $84.5 million and Republicans about $76.2 million. Philadelphia has drawn the most ad spending, nearly $63 million of the total, and Democrats have spent about $33.8 million there while Republicans have spent about $28.6 million. With millions flooding the Philadelphia market, the candidates and their allies are fighting to get their message out and leveling sharp attacks. Over the last week, the top ad on Philly airwaves has been a stark attack ad from the pro-Donald Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., with nearly $1 million behind it, highlighting violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Another top ad over the last week comes from the Trump campaign, backed by more than $700,000, slamming the Biden-Harris administration for inflation. On the other side, a network of pro-Kamala Harris outside groups has spent more than $500,000 airing an ad touting Harris’ economic vision, while Harris’ campaign is also up with an ad promoting her pitch for an “opportunity economy,” backed by nearly $350,000 in the last week. Behind Philadelphia, the Pittsburgh media market ranks second in Pennsylvania for ad spending, drawing about $36.5 million in ad spending since Biden dropped out, and Democrats lead there by about $20 million to $16.2 million. And the Harrisburg-Lancaster-Lebanon-York media market ranks third, with about $22.3 million in total ad spending, Democrats and Republicans running about even, $10.97 million to $11.2 million. For the most part, these markets are seeing the same ads that voters are seeing in Philadelphia and across the commonwealth.  Donald Trump posted two AI memes of cats as the former president’s campaign and other prominent Republicans promote false rumors about Haitian immigrants in Ohio killing and eating pets.  Trump posted on Truth Social a fake photo of what appears to be him on his plane surrounded by cats and ducks, as well as an AI photo of a cat wearing a MAGA hat and holding a gun.  Earlier Tuesday, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance acknowledged that it’s possible the false claim that Haitian immigrants are abducting the pets of Springfield, Ohio, residents might not be true, but he encouraged his followers to continue posting “cat memes.” The unsubstantiated claims appear to have begun as a rumor in a local Facebook group before being embraced and promoted by X owner and Trump supporter Elon Musk.  In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the city of Springfield said, “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” Former President Donald Trump’s walkthrough is underway on the debate stage, a source familiar told CNN. Trump, according to ABC News, won a virtual coin flip to determine podium placement and order of closing statements during the debate. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement and Vice President Kamala Harris chose the right podium position on screen. The debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET. Donald Trump has been ensconced in his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida for the last several days, undergoing debate prep with a team of advisers and outside allies.  As they’ve batted questions back and forth and prepared him to pivot on the debate stage tonight, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN his aides have also underscored one thing: don’t underestimate Vice President Kamala Harris on the debate stage. Trump has privately praised Hillary Clinton as a “brilliant” debater and speculated that Harris will be less of a challenge. But many of those around him have urged him not to expect a less formidable adversary in Harris tonight. They’ve combed over her other debate performances and her tough questioning at Senate hearings to remind him that she’s done well in the public eye in these moments before.  Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are facing off tonight in the ABC’s presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. It’s the first debate between the two nominees, and it comes with less than two months to go before Election Day. But it’s actually the second presidential debate of this election cycle. Take a look at scenes ahead of the debate. Former President Donald Trump is expected to do his walk through of the debate stage at any moment and in the lead up to tonight’s showdown, those around him are expressing confidence. Some of the advice that Trump has been given from those around him in recent days has centered around temperament, with allies urging Trump to maintain focus on talking about specific issues — especially immigration and inflation. Multiple sources close to Trump told CNN they believe if he can do that, he can come out of this debate on top.  Trump’s team has advised the former president that they believe Vice President Kamala Harris will try and get under his skin, something that has proven not to be that difficult to do, and warned him not to engage.  Trump did not sit for any mock debates ahead of his showdown with Harris Tuesday night. Most conversations about the debate happened informally in routine discussions with allies, or during what his team refers to as “policy time,” when senior advisors went through various potential questions and how to pivot away from political issues they believe are hurtful to the former president, like abortion.  Ahead of Tuesday night’s debate, Kamala Harris’ aides discussed how much time — if at all — the vice president should spend fact-checking former President Donald Trump, keenly aware of the times President Joe Biden attempted to do that in the last presidential debate that didn’t land, according to two sources familiar.   Harris aides and allies have frequently described Trump as a wild card and fully anticipate that he’ll spew falsehoods during the presidential debate.  Part of the debate preparations for Harris included how the vice president navigates those moments and avoids getting roped into a fact check back and forth, taking into account that the microphones will be turned off when the other candidate is speaking. “She’s not going to let him walk away from other important issues that Americans care the most about,” one source told CNN, adding that the advice to the vice president has been to “focus your limited time on speaking directly to American people.” Harris allies have also advised against being swept up by counting Trump’s falsehoods.  Instead, her team has directed her to return to the campaign’s foundational message that Harris, not Trump, is focused on solutions.   “She’s going up against someone who presents as a wild card and chaos agent. She’s very ready and very prepared,” one of the sources said. Former President Donald Trump has arrived in Philadelphia ahead of tonight’s presidential debate, which begins at 9 p.m. ET. Trump’s plane was taxiing shortly after 6:40 p.m. ET. Far-right conspiracist Laura Loomer, who maintains a relationship with Trump and regularly posts misinformation on social media, was seen getting off of the former president’s plane in Philadelphia with Trump staffers. Loomer’s presence around Trump has irked some of his top advisers, who believe she causes problems by feeding him conspiratorial information he later repeats. In addition to Loomer, Stephen Miller, Vince Haley, Natalie Harp, Lara Trump, Alina Habba and Chris LaCivita were also seen exiting plane. Debate preparations: CNN reported earlier today that members of Trump’s advance team have been on the ground in Philadelphia for a week, making sure every detail is accounted for when the former president takes the stage later tonight. Members of his team have measured the podium, the walk to the podium, and identified where every camera is located to brief him ahead of his walkthrough. Trump is known for his obsession with optics, and that trickles down to even junior staffers, who have been taking detailed notes on the setup to brief senior advisers and the former president when he arrives. Harris arrived in Philadelphia last night. This post has been updated with more details on individuals traveling with Trump. Kamala Harris’ campaign released a list of campaign surrogates expected in the debate spin room following Tuesday’s debate. The “spin room” is where supporters of each candidate put their “spin” on the debate in conversations with media. The list provided by the Harris campaign includes: On the debate stage tonight, Vice President Kamala Harris wants to win over undecided voters. But to do that, she needs to present herself as middle-of-the-road politically because a majority of them are moderates, CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday. According to polling this month from the New York Times/Siena College, 60% of undecided voters say they are moderates and 54% say they are independents. Of that group of undecided voters, 48% say they want to learn more about Harris, compared with 18% who say they want to hear more from Trump. “The bottom line is undecideds have made up their mind about Donald Trump. They don’t like him,” Enten said in his analysis, adding that Tuesday’s debate is an opportunity for Harris to give these voters exactly what they want. In terms of what these voters want to hear from the candidates, 30% say the economy and inflation are most important to them — but 28% say they don’t have a top issue in this election. That means this debate isn’t necessarily just about policy, “it’s about personalities of the candidates as well,” Enten said. “So I wouldn’t be trying to get in the minutia of policy details. You want to just show that you’re a strong leader; that you can, in fact, lead this country into the future,” he said. It was less than three months ago that President Joe Biden shocked Democrats with a debate performance against Donald Trump so disastrous that within weeks, he would be forced to end his reelection campaign. Tonight, it will be his vice president, Kamala Harris, who will face off against Trump. The president will be in New York City this evening ahead of the September 11 anniversary on Wednesday, and he plans to watch from his hotel. As he tunes in, the gravity of tonight is not lost on him. Biden understands through his own experience better than anybody what tonight is about, a source close to him said. That includes both the immense pressure and the excitement that comes with a presidential debate, as well as the focus that will be required of Harris, the source said. Biden and Harris have discussed the upcoming debate in recent weeks. But those close to the president have largely remained tight-lipped about what advice the president may or may not have offered his vice president, as Biden remains sensitive to giving Harris space to do what she needs. As for the mood inside the White House, some officials here describe nerves and anxiety as they point to the fact that Trump is a three-time Republican nominee who has done this numerous times. There is also a real sense of relief — a quiet acknowledgement that there is no chance tonight could go worse for Democrats than the last presidential debate. CNN chief national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny looks back at moments from Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s past debates to see what to expect in their encounter on Tuesday. Watch below: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said America will see a contrast between Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in tonight’s presidential debate, arguing that Harris will “lay out a plan for this country” while Trump will “talk about revenge.” Tonight’s showdown in Philadelphia is — for now — the only debate scheduled between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.  Depending on how the night goes, it may not be the last. Harris’s team has not ruled out an additional debate before November’s election, suggesting their willingness to agree to a second matchup would hinge on Trump actually showing up in Philadelphia. “I’m happy to have that conversation about an additional debate after September 10,” Harris said in August. “For sure.” Trump, for his part, has claimed to be ready for another debate against Harris at the end of September.  The fact that a second debate isn’t on the calendar is an indication both teams are watching to see how tonight goes before agreeing to anything. A bad night for either candidate would make another debate more uncertain. The rules for another debate would also likely be contested by both campaigns since the original parameters for the face-offs that were negotiated for then-candidate President Joe Biden wouldn’t apply. High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. In new CNN polling of six swing states, economic issues remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters in their choice for president. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump both unveiled more of their economic plans last week. Below is a snapshot of what the candidates have proposed on the topic so far. Highlights of Harris’ economic promises Highlights of Trump’s economic promises: Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. President Joe Biden described Vice President Kamala Harris as “cool, calm and collected” ahead of her first debate with former President Donald Trump on Tuesday. Biden stayed tightlipped about their conversation, adding he was “not going to tell you what advice I gave her.” The president said he was heading to attend his granddaughter’s birthday in New York and would watch the debate after. Donald Trump’s team wants to mimic the results of his first debate against President Joe Biden, down to the optics, as the former president prepares to face off with Vice President Kamala Harris. Members of Trump’s advance team have been on the ground in Philadelphia for a week, making sure every detail is accounted for when he takes the stage later tonight. Members of Trump’s team have measured the podium, the walk to the podium, and identified where every camera is located to brief him ahead of his walk-through. The former president is known for his obsession with optics, and that trickles down to even junior staffers, who have been taking detailed notes on the setup to brief senior advisers and Trump when he arrives. As allies have warned Trump not to let Harris get under his skin, they have also told him to respond with facial expressions over verbal outcries and reminded him that the camera will be constantly on him, even if he is not speaking. Many of his advisers believe that part of his success in the last of debate stemmed from how he presented himself onstage, particularly in comparison with Biden. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday rallied young Arizona voters ahead of Tuesday’s debate, telling them, “do not underestimate the power you have” and declaring that the antidote to the current state of politics is for them to reengage. During the campaign stop, his first solo trip to Arizona, Walz told the audience, “Do not underestimate the power you have, not just on your peers, but on others.” DirecTV has rejected Disney’s offer to air ABC‘s presidential debate tonight amid a bitter carriage dispute that has forced a blackout of Disney-owned networks for the satellite carrier’s 11 million customers.  In a statement Tuesday, DirecTV said Disney’s offer to carry Disney-owned ABC stations solely for the debate “will cause customer confusion among those who would briefly see the debate only to lose the channel again shortly after.” DirecTV said it instead made a counteroffer to Disney, agreeing to return ABC “in time for tonight’s Presidential Debate if Disney is also willing to return all its channels across platforms through the end of Monday NightFootball at 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday, Sept. 17.” That would allow viewers to also watch the Emmy Awards ceremony on Sunday, Sept. 16 that will air on ABC.  But Disney rejected the offer, DirecTV said.  Since ABC has agreed to simulcast tonight’s presidential debate on other networks, DirecTV said its customers will still be able to watch the face-off between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on other channels.  ABC News officially announced the rules last week of tonight’s presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden. Here are the rules of the face off: Harris’ camp had lobbied for the mics to remain on for the duration of the debate. “Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the letter from the Harris campaign to the network, shared in part with CNN, said. The network, according to the source familiar, offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said. You will be able to watch the ABC debate live on CNN tonight at 9 p.m. ET. CNN’s Hadas Gold and Kate Sullivan contributed reporting to this post. Part of Kamala Harris’ campaign strategy going into today is to use the presidential debate as an opportunity to introduce the vice president to undecided voters, alongside trying to expose former President Donald Trump and “his true colors,” as one source described it to CNN. While the campaign has boasted of the recent momentum behind the vice president, Harris aides and allies see Tuesday night’s debate as an opening to try to broaden the base.  Sources close to the campaign describe the vice president as keenly aware of the strategies Trump is likely to employ, but her team is also preparing her to remain focused on the policy issues and her vision to reach those persuadable voters.  It’s not wholly unlike the strategy Harris had previously been planning for—reminding voters of the unpredictability of Trump and, as she’s repeatedly mentioned on the trail, what her campaign has cast as attacks to personal freedoms. Before Harris became the lead of the party’s ticket, her team had been preparing her to take that message against Trump’s vice presidential nominee, JD Vance. That has spilled into her preparations heading into Tuesday.  “She’s been prepping for this for a long time,” one source told CNN. “Vance was a stand-in for Trump. We were always taking it to Trump.” Former President Donald Trump is in good spirits ahead of tonight’s debate, Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a call with reporters. Trump is at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and will be departing shortly for Philadelphia, the spokesperson said. The Trump campaign also said that the “bar is very high” for Vice President Kamala Harris and that it “may be the one and only debate.” Alvarez added that the American people know “who Trump is,” but “what we don’t know is Kamala Harris.” Vice President Kamala Harris will face off against former President Donald Trump in Philadelphia in their first presidential debate tonight. The debate, hosted by ABC News and moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, comes as the latest polls show the race for the White House remains tight. More on the debate: ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden, during which the candidates’ microphones were muted as their opponent spoke. It was a rule that the Biden campaign had insisted on but something the Harris campaign had sought to change after she became a presidential candidate. The network’s rules also state that there will be no audience, the candidates will not be permitted to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two commercial breaks and the candidates cannot ask questions of one another. The world knows what kind of a debater former President Donald Trump is: loose with the facts, quick with an insult and confident to the extreme. But what about Vice President Kamala Harris? While her 2020 presidential campaign barely registered – she ended her campaign in December 2019, before the first primary votes were cast – Harris did leave a mark in one important way. On the primary debate stage in June 2019, before she was his running mate or he was anywhere near the White House, Harris eviscerated Joe Biden. “That little girl was me”: The issues of policing and race were key to the 2020 Democratic primary. “I do not believe that you are a racist,” Harris told Biden, staring him down across the debate stage as he looked straight ahead or down at his podium. But it was hurtful, she said, that Biden would praise men like the late Sens. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and John Stennis of Mississippi, “who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.” Pivoting, she noted that during his long Senate career, Biden worked with these men on legislation opposed to federally mandated busing in local school districts. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,” Harris said. “And that little girl was me.” It was a powerful moment, evidence of what Harris can do on the debate stage – clearly rehearsed, deployed effectively, unsparing and said to the face of her opponent, who would later elevate her as his running mate. Keep reading here about Harris’ debate skills. Following the debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, the Harris campaign is planning a series of high-dollar fundraisers headlined by the vice president herself, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as it continues ramping up spending across battleground states.  On Saturday, Vice President Harris will headline a fundraiser in Washington, DC, hosted by the Harris Victory Fund, according to an invite obtained by CNN.  Given the condensed timeframe that Harris has to ramp up her ground game and re-introduce herself to voters, most of Harris’ fundraising events to date have been helmed by surrogates, including her vice presidential pick, Gov. Tim Walz, and her husband, Doug Emhoff, as well as a handful of Democratic governors and lawmakers.  Fundraising, for Harris and Walz, has been a bright spot. Harris’ campaign fundraising has dwarfed that of former President Donald Trump — in August, the Harris campaign reported it’d brought in $361 million, compared to the Trump campaign’s $130 million. According to the campaign, August also marked the best month for grassroots fundraising in presidential history, with 1.3 million donors making their first donation of the 2024 election cycle. Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record and outlined her policies. Here’s a look at what both candidates have proposed on the issue: Trump Harris Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s stances on key issues. Former President Donald Trump will be joined by two family members and a series of his top campaign advisers at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday, a source familiar with the campaign’s plans told CNN.  The former president’s eldest son, Eric Trump, as well as Eric Trump’s his wife and RNC co-chair Lara Trump are expected to join the former president at the venue and accompany him to a holding room onsite, the source said. Trump’s co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, as well as senior advisers Corey Lewandowski, Jason Miller, Steven Cheung and Taylor Budowich are also planning to join him at the venue — helping the former president prepare right up until the moment he appears for his showdown with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump’s social media director, Dan Scavino, will be in Philadelphia and is planning to post live on X from the former president’s account throughout the course of the debate, two sources familiar with the plans said. An important part of Vice President Kamala Harris’ preparations to debate Donald Trump Tuesday night has entailed getting ready for possible insults, derogatory comments and name-calling from the former president, two sources familiar said.   The team helping to prepare Harris have had to look no further than Trump’s recent public comments, including at his political rallies, to get a sense of the kinds of things the GOP nominee may say on the debate stage.  It is anybody’s guess just how much Trump will be inclined to try to personally insult his rival tomorrow night — and how much of it will even be heard by the public, given that candidates’ mics will be off when it is not their turn to speak. If the mics were on the entire time, the Harris adviser said, “it would show he does not have the temperament to be president.”  As she has been reading up on Trump’s policy positions, past comments and even insults he has directed at her, two people Harris has extensively spoken with are President Joe Biden and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton — both have experienced insults thrown their way by the former GOP president on the debate stage.  Coming just weeks after the Democratic National Convention, where Harris formally accepted her party’s nomination for the presidency, the vice president’s advisers see Tuesday’s ABC News debate as a critical opportunity to speak to voters, including those who are starting to tune in for the first time and are interested in giving her a second look.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be in Philadelphia tonight for the presidential debate as a surrogate for former President Donald Trump, a spokesperson for Kennedy told CNN on Sunday. Kennedy will appear in the spin room — where supporters of each candidate put their “spin” on the debate in conversations with media — on behalf of Trump, the spokesperson said. Kennedy endorsed Trump and suspended his independent White House bid last month, urging his supporters to back the former president. Trump has said Kennedy would play a role in his administration if he is elected. Kennedy’s alliance with Trump came after a long history of attacking the former president. Trump’s running mate: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance will also hit the spin room Tuesday, after attending a Philadelphia debate watch party hosted by the Trump campaign, according to a source familiar with the plans. Earlier on Tuesday, Vance has a fundraiser in Greenville, North Carolina.  CNN’s Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post. The most important moment in the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump comes tonight, as the vice president prepares for what could be her only opportunity to directly confront a former president whose political dominance she is pledging to end. Their Tuesday night debate is particularly important for Harris, who is battling to define herself in voters’ eyes and keep up the positive momentum she’s enjoyed since becoming the Democratic Party’s new nominee this summer. The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be the first face-to-face encounter between Harris and Trump, who are locked in a tight race. For Harris, it’s a marquee moment to show Americans that she is ready to assume the presidency, a question very much on the minds of voters as the fall campaign intensifies. Trump, meanwhile, is eager to negatively shape voters’ perceptions of his Democratic rival and halt the gains she has made since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket in July. Harris has eliminated what for much of the year had been Trump’s lead over Biden in presidential polling. Both Harris and Trump are offering themselves as change agents of sorts. Harris has pitched herself as a clean break from a bitterly divisive era of politics dominated by Trump. The former president, though, points to Harris’ time in the Biden administration and says she bears the blame for inflation, higher mortgage rates and more. Trump’s campaign and his allies have accused Harris of avoiding policy particulars. But Trump’s incoherent answer last week to a question about how he would make child care more affordable was a vivid reminder that the former president has long brushed aside policy details and questions about the practicality of his proposals. Keep reading here about tonight’s showdown. The race to Election Day in November is on. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will have their first face-to-face encounter tonight as they take the debate stage in Philadelphia. Early voting will also get underway in September. North Carolina was supposed to be the first state to send mail-in ballots, on September 6, but a dispute over whether Robert F. Kennedy Jr. can remove his name from the ballot has caused a delay. Kennedy suspended his independent presidential bid in August and endorsed Trump. Other states begin sending mail-in ballots later in the month. Voters in most of the country have the option of requesting a mail-in ballot, and voters in eight of those states and Washington, DC, will get a mail-in ballot automatically. The other states require an excuse for mail-in ballots. October begins with a vice presidential debate between Vance and Walz, hosted by CBS. While Election Day isn’t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process will kick into overdrive in October. Read more about what is coming up in the road to Election Day. In just one month, the presidential election changed dramatically in the United States.  President Joe Biden pulled out of the race on July 21, a few weeks after a disastrous debate performance that had Democratic allies wanting him to step aside and “pass the torch” for the good of the party and the country. He threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, who has secured the Democratic nomination and is looking to become the nation’s first-ever female president. Eight days before Biden dropped out, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The shooting shocked the world and unified many Republicans around their nominee, who lost to Biden four years ago. With just a couple of months to go until Election Day, we look back at the unprecedented events that have shaped this race. See more photos from this year’s historic election cycle. In poll after poll, Americans have indicated the economy is their top concern as they prepare to cast votes this election. Here’s a look at what could happen to inflation, jobs and the deficit if Trump or Harris win in November: Inflation: Trump’s tariff policy would controversially charge dramatically higher import taxes on practically everything that comes into the country’s ports from overseas. That could raise revenue for the government, but also cause Americans to pay more for goods and services. Trump promises to drill a lot more oil, a key cost for many businesses, to bring down prices — but there’s an open question over whether he could achieve that. The United States is already pumping more oil than any nation in history. Additionally, the unprecedented immigration crackdown Trump has vowed if he returns to the White House could also lead to higher inflation, economists say, despite Trump recently asserting prices would “come down dramatically and come down fast” as a result. Meanwhile, Harris’ policies aren’t inflation-proof. The first-time homeowner tax credit and tripling of the child tax credit for newborns she’s proposed could leave consumers with more money to spend on goods and services. But as a result, that could increase the prices they pay for them. Harris has also proposed a plan that her team says would result in 3 million housing units. The issue is the timing: If the first-time homebuyer credit goes into effect before more new units are available, it could cause home prices to spike. One potential wildcard for inflation is the two candidates’ different approaches to the Federal Reserve, the independent central bank tasked with controlling inflation. Harris has promised a hands-off approach, while Trump has suggested the president should have influence in decision-making — an argument he later walked back. Read more about how a Trump or Harris victory could impact jobs and the deficit. Over the last few days, Donald Trump’s advisers and allies have been prepping the former President for how to respond to potentially goading remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris, two sources familiar with the conversations told CNN.  Trump, who is notoriously reactive, has been advised by those close to him not to respond if Harris tries to get under his skin, at least not verbally. His team believes and has warned the former president that part of the reason that Harris wanted unmuted microphones was to potentially try and get a rise out of Trump, which is historically not hard to do, while she is talking. Some allies have stressed that it would be better for him to respond with facial expressions, rather than verbal asides or attacks.  Trump’s team is keenly aware of their candidate’s temperament and how his often aggressive behavior will play differently with a woman. When asked by about whether there would be a “tone change” compared to how Trump approached his debate with Biden, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who has been helping Trump prepare for the debate, argued Trump wouldn’t speak to Harris in “any other way than he would speak to a man.” “President Trump respects women and doesn’t feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man, so he is speaking to the American people, he is speaking to Kamala Harris’ record and comparing and contrasting that with his record of success,” Gabbard said.  However, this posture is what many Republicans have expressed concern over, noting that Trump should restrain from personal attacks. Trump has long been known for the brash, even vulgar way he sometimes speaks about women. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to lean into reproductive rights and needle former President Donald Trump over his muddled messaging on abortion during Tuesday night’s debate, according to two sources familiar.  Democrats have seized on abortion ahead of November, seeing it as a salient political issue that could spur moderate voters — particularly women — to turn out in droves against Trump by tying the abortion bans directly to him. Recent CNN polls found Harris has built on former President Joe Biden’s lead as more trusted to handle abortion and reproductive rights, with women across battleground states preferring her by an average of 27 percentage points on the issue. She’s expected to double down on messaging tying Trump to abortion bans this Tuesday, according to the source, especially following Trump’s statement that he would vote against a ballot measure in his home state of Florida that would make abortion legal up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy.  That would leave in place the state’s six-week ban, which Trump has publicly said he disagrees with and has called “too short.” The Harris campaign also recently launched a reproductive rights tour, kicking it off in Florida where abortion is on the ballot. It’s expected to include at least 50 stops nationwide. As she was hunkered down in Pittsburgh over the weekend to prepare to debate Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris sought advice from one woman who has experienced facing off against the former president: Hillary Clinton.  The two women spoke on the phone over the weekend, a source familiar with the conversation tells CNN, marking one of multiple times that the pair has been in touch since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race earlier this year. Harris and Clinton discussed tonight’s debate, with the former Democratic nominee offering the vice president her advice, though the source declined to get into details of their private conversation.  Clinton has expressed in conversations with those close to her recently that in looking back at her on her own experience of having gone toe-to-toe with Trump in 2016, “baiting him into self-destruction” is one of the best things that the vice president could do tonight, according to the source who is familiar with her thinking.  Clinton has mentioned, for example, that she believes one of the single lowest debate moments for Trump eight years ago was when he tried to attack Clinton by saying Russian President Vladimir Putin had no respect for her.  She cut in, responding: “Well, that’s because he’d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.” That prompted one of the most memorable exchanges of the final presidential debate of the 2016 cycle, with Trump shooting back: “No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet. No, you’re the puppet.”  Clinton has described that moment in the years since as one of real unraveling for Trump — and of a kind that she believes could be possible to replicate tonight if Harris were to give him the room to do so.  CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. Ahead of tonight’s debate, Rep. Richard Hudson, who chairs the House Republican’s campaign arm, told CNN’s Manu Raju he believes Vice President Harris has been able to bring Democrats back into the fold, but argued that she has failed to sway Republican voters to her side. However, notable Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney, Mesa, Arizona Mayor John Giles and former lieutenant governor of Georgia Geoff Duncan have thrown their support behind Harris. During the Democratic National Convention, the Harris campaign also highlighted more regular Republicans who have been turned away by Trump, including former MAGA activist Rich Logis and Alabama Republican Kyle Sweetser. In terms of Congressional races, Hudson acknowledged that Republicans face a funding shortage compared to House Democrats as they enter the post-Labor Day phase of the campaign, which will have an impact on advertising. However, he argued that he is still bullish about their prospects and insisted Republicans can expand their House majority next Congress. “We’re well positioned to pick up seats in the House. We’ve got great candidates who are building strong campaigns. We’re raising good money, but Democrats are ahead of us on the money game, so we’ve got to keep pouring it on,” he said. “They have structural advantages, and certainly, when Harris came on, we saw a flood of fundraising, so that helped them,” he added. “We’re going to win the majority, I’m just – it’s a question of what the size of the next conference will be.” Kamala Harris’ campaign is dispatching a handful of governors – including several hailing from some of the most critical battleground states – to defend the vice president’s debate performance against Donald Trump in the spin room tonight in Philadelphia.   Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico and Gavin Newsom of California will be the governors on deck on behalf of the Harris campaign, a source familiar says.  Cooper and Harris served at the same time as their respective states’ attorneys general. In addition to having a close personal relationship with Harris, he is someone the campaign has leaned on to help defend her record as California attorney general. The White House called false claims pushed by some Republicans that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets “concerning,” “dangerous” and “based on an element of racism.” The comments, from White House national security spokesperson John Kirby, amounted to a forceful denunciation of the claims being peddled by several prominent Republicans, including the party’s vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance. “I think all Americans should expect more and better from the people that they’re electing to represent them,” Kirby said. Some background: The false claims center on the Ohio city of Springfield, which has experienced a surge in recent migration from Haitians seeking to escape a Caribbean country that has been rocked from years of natural disasters, political assassinations and gang rule. In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said “there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” Kirby said the disinformation obscured a larger conversation about immigration in the United States. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance acknowledged Tuesday that it’s possible the false claim that Haitian immigrants are abducting the pets of Ohio residents might not be true, but he encouraged his followers to continue posting “cat memes.” Vance promoted false claims on Monday that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets, though his post on Tuesday made no mention of Haitians “eating” them. It’s the latest turn in a campaign that has increasingly embraced race-baiting messaging, questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity while seeking to undermine her immigration policies. The rumors center on the Ohio city of Springfield, which has experienced a surge in recent migration from Haitians seeking to escape a Caribbean country that has been rocked from years of natural disasters, political assassinations and gang rule. A post in a Springfield Facebook group recently claimed a neighbor’s daughter’s friend found their missing cat hanging from a branch at a Haitian neighbor’s home, and it was being prepped to be eaten, according to the Springfield News-Sun. Those rumors were picked up by conservative media and then spread on X, where they gained widespread traction on Monday. Vance posted a video of himself discussing migration to Ohio at a recent hearing. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country. Where is our border czar?” Some accounts shared AI-generated pictures of Trump holding a cat in his hands while being chased by crowds of Black men. The unsubstantiated claims appear to be the result of an unwieldy game of telephone that began as a rumor in a local Facebook group before spiraling to reach the highest echelons of conservative media and the Republican Party. Read more here about the false rumor about Haitian immigrants The post was updated with Vance’s comments from Tuesday. The Trump campaign on Tuesday released a new video seeking to blame Vice President Kamala Harris for crime, inflation and illegal immigration that has taken place under the Biden administration.  The video uses clips of former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance arguing Harris’ “Day one” was the first day President Joe Biden took office and uses clips of Harris talking about what she would do on “Day one” if elected. “Where has she been, and why hasn’t she done it?” Trump says in the video.  Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement released with the video, “Kamala Harris has been in the White House for an unimaginable American decline. Basic goods cost more, illegal migrant crime ravages our communities, and we have lost our role as the global leader whose strength brings peace. Her Day One came and went years ago, and she can’t hide from that.” On the trail, Trump has sought to tie Harris to Biden’s record, particularly on the border, while frequently issuing gender- and race-baiting personal attacks. Specifically, when Harris has stuck by Biden’s policies, Trump has attacked them and her as a failure. And when Harris has tried to separate herself from her boss, in a manner or practice, Trump has asked why she didn’t do more over the past four years. Americans saw their incomes rise last year, even after accounting for inflation. Median household income rose to $80,610 in 2023, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. That’s up 4% from the year before. Americans’ finances are a key talking point in this year’s presidential election. Former President Donald Trump argues that people were better off in his first term and have suffered from the spike in prices in recent years. Vice President Kamala Harris has stressed that she will focus on strengthening the middle class and has released proposals that aim to reduce people’s cost of living. Read more about Harris and Trump’s economic proposals here. Kamala Harris’ campaign has been trying to throw Donald Trump off balance for days ahead of Tuesday’s debate with back-to-back ads airing in Philadelphia trolling the former president.  And their efforts won’t stop there. The campaign plans to bring former Trump officials to the debate Tuesday night. Former Trump officials Anthony Scaramucci and Olivia Troye — who both support Harris — will hold a press availability ahead at the debate site, where the campaign says, “they will speak out against Trump and for Harris ahead of tonight’s debate.” It’s an extension of a campaign ad released earlier this week that features former Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley warning against a second Trump term. “Listen, don’t take it from us: Take it from the ones who know Donald Trump the best and who are telling the American people exactly how unfit Trump is to serve as president,” said Michael Tyler, Harris-Walz 2024 communications director, in a statement. Ahead of the presidential debate, the Harris campaign is accusing the Trump-Vance ticket of “ratcheting up their dangerous lies” after Sen. JD Vance wouldn’t commit to answering if he would have certified the 2020 election results. Vance was pressed several times during an interview on David Sacks’ “All-In” podcast on whether he would’ve certified the 2020 election results and said he would have “asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors.” He also argued former Vice President Mike Pence “could have played a better role” in surfacing what he called “some of the problems” with the election. When the timing and rules negotiations for the ABC presidential debate began months ago, President Joe Biden was still the candidate at the top of the ticket. No longer on the ballot, Biden’s Tuesday is looking decidedly different.  Biden will spend part of the day engaged in the perks of the presidency as he welcomes NCAA champion basketball teams, the University of South Carolina Gamecocks women’s team and the University of Connecticut men’s team, to the White House to celebrate their March Madness wins.  In the afternoon, Biden heads to New York ahead of Wednesday morning’s September 11 commemorations. He’s “proud” of his former running mate, and “looking forward” to watching Vice President Kamala Harris face off with former President Donald Trump from his Manhattan hotel, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.  Biden and Harris will appear together throughout the day on Wednesday as they make solemn visits to each site of the September 11th attacks – New York City, Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and the Pentagon. Biden is expected to be an active surrogate for Harris in the coming months, simultaneously working to burnish his legacy and doing what he can to set up his vice president for success in November. Former first lady Melania Trump on Wednesday raised questions about the assassination attempt against her husband in a new video and claimed there was “more to the story.” Melania Trump has maintained a low profile throughout her husband’s 2024 campaign but has been releasing videos promoting her new book over the past week. Wednesday’s video is her third video in recent days, and they all link to pre-ordering her book.  The head of the US Secret Service resigned in the wake of the July assassination attempt that took place at a Trump campaign rally in Pennsylvania amid scrutiny over security lapses leading up to the shots fired by the gunman at the rally.  The former director, Kimberly Cheatle, was grilled by lawmakers in the wake of the attack and during a House hearing said before Trump took the stage on July 13, the Secret Service had been notified “between two and five times” that there was a suspicious person in the area. She said at the time that the agency was looking into the apparent communication breakdown – which led to Trump going onstage even amid these reports of a suspicious person, and as rallygoers saw the shooter with a gun in the immediate moments before the shots rang out. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name will be removed from the North Carolina ballot, the state Supreme Court ruled Monday. In a 4-3 decision, with both of the Democratic members and one Republican dissenting, the GOP-controlled court wrote that having accurate ballots is more important than the costs and delays that will come from having to reprint the state’s ballots. Absentee ballots in North Carolina were supposed to start going out on Friday but were held amid the legal fight over Kennedy’s removal after he dropped his independent bid for president. According to the state board of elections, absentee voting could now be delayed nearly two weeks while ballots are reprinted. Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Read the full story. Vice President Kamala Harris averages 49% support across recent polls while former President Donald Trump stands at 48% in the latest CNN Poll of Polls. That average suggests no clear leader in the contest heading into tonight’s presidential debate.   The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of the six most recent non-partisan, national surveys of registered or likely voters that meet CNN’s standards and ask about a 2024 presidential general election between Harris and Trump. Surveys including named third-party or independent candidates are not included. The new average is unchanged since its last update and is based on six recent national polls, all conducted after the Democratic National Convention in August. It includes an NPR/PBS News/Marist College poll released this morning, which found no clear leader in the race with Harris at 49% to Trump’s 48% among registered voters. Five of the six polls included in the average found the margin between the two candidates at 1 point or less.  The NPR/PBS/Marist poll finds 72% of registered voters nationwide say they plan to watch tonight’s debate, with 30% saying they think it will matter a great deal or a good amount to their choice for president. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance has said he would have “asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors” in the 2020 election. “I would have asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors and let the country have the debate about what actually matters and what kind of an election that we had in these important states,” Vance said on the “All-In Podcast” on Monday night. Vance was pressed several times on whether he would’ve certified the 2020 election results. Vance argued former Vice President Mike Pence “could have played a better role” in surfacing what he called “some of the problems” with the 2020 election. “I don’t think the argument was Mike Pence could overturn the election results. I think the argument was that Mike Pence could have done more – whether you agree or disagree – Mike Pence could have done more to surface some of the problems in the 2020 election,” Vance said.  “Pence was not asked to overturn the election. He couldn’t have,” Vance said. While there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, Vance said he believes there were “issues,” particularly in battleground Pennsylvania. “Even some of the courts that refused to throw out certified ballots did say that there were ballots that were cast in an illegal way. They just refused to actually decertify the election results in Pennsylvania. “Do I think that we could have had a much more rational conversation about how to ensure that only legal ballots are cast? Yes. And do I think that Mike Pence could have played a better role? Yes,” Vance said. The Trump campaign on Monday previewed some of the lines of attack that former President Donald Trump is likely to deploy during ABC’s presidential debate tonight. The campaign argued that Vice President Kamala Harris “owns everything from this administration.” In a call with reporters ahead of Tuesday’s debate, Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller pointed to the handling of the US-Mexico border and illegal immigration, Harris casting tie-breaking votes in the Senate to pass stimulus bills and the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as issues that the campaign believes Harris “owns.”  Miller also said he expects “there’ll be some surprises during the debate tomorrow.” Miller pointed to Harris’ interview with CNN in which she said her “values have not changed,” even as her positions on some issues have changed, and argued that answer, “really opens the door to talking about what are those values, what has Kamala Harris stood for over the years going all the way back to the beginning.” Miller claimed Harris has been the one in charge of the country, not President Joe Biden, and at one point referred to the Biden administration as the “Harris-Biden” administration, though Harris is not the president.  On Trump, Miller said that the former president is “going to be himself. I think that’s an important thing to keep in mind here.” Adding that Harris is “in this debate bootcamp being drilled by new advisers who worked for President Obama that she doesn’t know.” Miller said, “All these new people, these strangers trying to put thoughts in her head. These binders of stats and details. She has no idea what any of this is. No idea whatsoever. And she’s trying to figure out what type of person she wants to be, because her positions are changing, though her values have stayed the same.”  Asked how Trump has been preparing, Miller said Trump has been giving both longer interviews and shorter pull-aside interviews, news conferences, rally speeches and town halls.  “Every possible style of question President Trump is prepared for because that’s what he’s been doing this entire campaign,” he said. Ahead of the debate, Donald Trump‘s campaign released a list of 47 former prosecutors who are backing Trump this cycle. This comes as Trump is expected to attack Vice President Kamala Harris’s record as a prosecutor tonight on the debate stage. Harris’ campaign, on the other hand, is leaning into her prosecutorial background, a return to the “prosecutor for president” framework of her 2020 presidential campaign, with a focus on contrasting her with Trump as a felon. Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump said that Donald Trump is well-prepared for tonight’s presidential debate versus Vice President Kamala Harris and is ready to talk about why voters’ lives were better during his administration. “I think Donald Trump is very focused on this debate tonight … he has been preparing for this debate,” she told Kasie Hunt on “CNN This Morning.”  Donald Trump, who argued he doesn’t need formal preparation such as mock debates, has been meeting with senior advisers, policy experts and outside allies to ready himself for Tuesday. The “policy discussions” — the Trump campaign’s version of debate prep — largely mirror those the former president held in the weeks leading up to his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden, sources familiar with the meetings told CNN. The RNC co-chair continued that in “stark contrast” with Harris, Trump has done not only “traditional debate prep,” but has also spoken with the media in town halls, press conferences, podcasts and sit-down interviews because “he wants to engage more with the public, not less.” For this reason, she argued Harris is the candidate who has “upped the stakes” of tonight’s faceoff for herself.   Lara Trump equivocated when pressed about her father-in-law citing an “election expert” who indicated “that 20% of the Mail-In Ballots in Pennsylvania are fraudulent” in a recent Truth Social post. She said that she “didn’t see that report” so she “can’t speak directly to that,” but explained that the Republican National Committee is working hard to ensure “your vote matters and your vote counts.” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore declined to definitively say whether Vice President Kamala Harris is a progressive or centrist, despite polling showing that voters feel they need to learn more about the Democratic presidential candidate ahead of tonight’s debate in Philadelphia. “I think Kamala Harris is someone who knows how to get things done,” the Democratic governor told Kasie Hunt on “CNN This Morning.” Moore continued that Harris is “talking about practical things,” and pointed specifically to her position on the child tax credit. Moore added, “I don’t know how putting her into a classification or box is useful.” The Harris campaign plans to use Tuesday night’s debate as a tool for organizing, hosting over 1,300 watch parties across the country. More than 100 of those watch parties are aimed at young voters on college campuses, the campaign said, and more than 300 of the parties will be aimed at different key coalitions, including Republicans for Harris-Walz, Veterans for Harris-Walz, and Latino house parties.  Harris’ team is hoping to turn the enthusiasm into action, with attendees set to “make calls to voters in battleground states and share debate content using the digital organizing tool Reach,” according to a press release. And as the campaign seeks to reach voters outside of major media outlets, it has invited digital creators to the watch parties, continuing its efforts to expand beyond a traditional media strategy.  Harris’ running mate: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will attend a debate watch party in Phoenix, Arizona. While Walz will be watching the debate in Arizona, his wife, Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, will attend a watch party in La Crosse, Wisconsin.  Paul Dans, the former group director behind conservative policy roadmap Project 2025, said Monday that he’d like to see Donald Trump implement the plan if elected. Dans told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins in his first TV interview since stepping down as director in July that Trump “had nothing to do with” the Heritage Foundation-backed playbook forged by dozens of organizations. But Dans, the former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management under Trump, said he’s been to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on “several” occasions and has met with his campaign leadership “from time to time.” He said he’d “shaken hands” with Trump, most recently in February. His comments come as Vice President Kamala Harris and her allies have sought to link Trump to Project 2025 to portray him as extreme. Democrats have repeatedly pointed to the set of conservative policies as the Republican Party’s roadmap if they return to the White House. Dans also said he’s not worried about Harris invoking the proposal against Trump in today’s debate. Trump has denied involvement with Project 2025, saying earlier this year that “some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.” But at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found. Dans said Trump was not involved in crafting the proposal and said the number of former Trump administration employees contributing to the project was an example of “natural” coordination between former colleagues. Read the full story. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance has addressed former Vice President Dick Cheney’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, saying his party “traded Dick Cheney for Bobby Kennedy.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the presidential race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Vance said politicians like Cheney, Harris, and their donors have benefitted from “the last 30 years of the bipartisan consensus” and manufacturing policy that promoted offshoring jobs – at the expense of people like his constituents in Ohio. Arguing Republicans are “increasingly the party of working and middle-class people,” Vance claimed, “wealthy people direct their money to Democrats,” and the working and middle class direct their money to Republicans. Vance was asked about how he would approach his role as vice president. “I want to be a second set of eyes and ears for the President’s agenda.” Vance said if Trump earns a second term, his administration team must execute his agenda. As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump take the stage tonight in Philadelphia in their first face-to-face meeting, the spotlight will also shine on the host of the debate: ABC News. Moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis will have a much different view in front of them than when ABC News first secured the high-stakes presidential debate in May. Since then, Harris has become the Democratic nominee, shaking up not just the race for the White House but also the negotiation process ahead of the televised faceoff. It’s a big test for the Disney-owned network in the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign. Everything ABC News does, from the moderators’ questions to the lighting, will be heavily scrutinized by the candidates and the public during the 90-minute showdown. In the weeks leading up to tonight’s debate, a behind the scenes drama has played out at ABC News as network executives sought to lock down the ground rules and format for the match up. ABC had planned to mostly mirror the rules used by CNN in its presidential debate in June between President Joe Biden and Trump, eschewing a live audience and muting the candidates’ microphones while their rival is speaking — a rule initially requested by Biden’s team prior to the CNN debate. But Harris’ team wanted the mics hot the entire night and demanded the network change the rule. Some of Harris’ most memorable moments in previous debates and in Senate hearings have come during cross talk. Her campaign, according to people familiar with the matter, believed that muting the microphones will make Trump appear more disciplined, and expressed frustration that ABC was not willing to budge on the rule. Read the full story. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will attend a debate watch party in Phoenix, Arizona, on Tuesday, part of the Harris campaign’s nationwide organizing effort pegged to the most consequential evening of Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to date.  The campaign is organizing more than 1,300 debate watch parties across the country, including some featuring prominent surrogates. While Walz will be watching the debate in Arizona, his wife, Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, will attend a watch party in La Crosse, Wisconsin.  Many of the events will be organized as coalition gathering events, with groups like Republicans for Harris-Walz, Veterans for Harris-Walz and Latinos Con Harris-Walz in battleground states in the south. Those events will be complemented by more than 100 campaign-organized watch parties on college campuses as part of the campaign’s effort to engage college-aged voters through on-campus advertising, social media advertising and virtual trainings in creating social content that aligns with the campaign’s message.  The organizing push underscores the critical moment Tuesday’s debate presents as Harris’ campaign seeks in part to maintain the surge in grassroots enthusiasm the vice president has embraced since joining the top of the Democratic ticket. A New York Times/Siena College national poll of likely voters released on Sunday found that 91% of Democrats said they were enthusiastic about voting, slightly edging the 85% of Republicans who said the same. Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign has turned former President Barack Obama’s Democratic convention mockery of Donald Trump’s crowd-size fixation into a television ad — complete with the yes-he-went-there hand gesture. The spot will air on cable news and in markets that appear intentionally selected to grab the Republican nominee’s attention: West Palm Beach, where he lives, and Philadelphia, where he’ll be Tuesday ahead of his debate with Harris. The campaign said channels airing the ad include Fox News. The spot features Obama’s remarks from last month’s convention in Chicago questioning Trump’s temperament and fitness for office.  “Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems,” Obama said in his speech.  “This weird obsession with crowd sizes,” Obama continued, “it just goes on, and on, and on.” At that point in his speech, Obama moved his hands together in a way that suggested Trump’s size concerns were not limited to crowds. The ad lingers on Obama’s hands, ensuring the innuendo isn’t lost.  The ad appears in keeping with one aspect of Harris’ strategy heading into Tuesday’s debate: finding ways to get underneath Trump’s skin, in the hopes of provoking an angry reaction.   Obama’s speech in the ad is spliced with footage of Trump discussing Harris’s crowds, along with footage of Trump events meant to show sparse audiences — though some video appears to have been shot before the events began.  The Harris campaign also said it was using the crowd size attack line in local advertising in Philadelphia ahead of the debate, including on taxis, projections and sidewalk art.  Kamala Harris’ joyful campaign will be hit today by the blunt force of reality — a debate with Donald Trump — the most menacing political foe of modern times. The vice president transformed the election after President Joe Biden’s abject debate showing against Trump on CNN led him to end his reelection bid. She restored several swing states to the electoral battlefield and has had Democrats dreaming of a stunning turnabout in a race most thought they were well on the way to losing. Yet her success in unifying her party, branding herself as a fresh voice of generational change and closing into a dead heat with Trump in polling has not cemented a reliable path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. If the election were today, the ex-president, who has already defied an assassination attempt and scores of criminal charges, could still win. Presidential debates usually don’t decide elections — notwithstanding the cataclysmic impact of Biden’s wipeout. But tonight is the best remaining chance for Harris to drive home a decisive argument that could thwart Trump’s historic comeback. Her assignment in Philadelphia will require rhetorical skills that have often been questioned in an uneven vice presidency. While she has had her moments in debates and Senate hearings, Harris has sometimes struggled to articulate clear policies and answers under pressure in spontaneous situations. While the former president has now taken part in presidential debates in three separate elections, this will be Harris’ first venture onto the debate stage since her meeting with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. Read the full analysis. Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance continue to falsely describe how one of their major policy proposals, across-the-board tariffs, would work. Trump has falsely, and repeatedly, claimed that China – not US importers – pays the tariff. At a rally in Arizona in mid-August, he claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, is lying when she refers to his tariff plan as a “Trump tax.” “She is a liar. She makes up crap … I am going to put tariffs on other countries coming into our country, and that has nothing to do with taxes to us. That is a tax on another country,” Trump said. In September, he repeated the claim during an interview with Fox News that it’s “a tax on another country.” Vance said in late August that as a result of tariffs Trump imposed during his presidency, “prices went down for American citizens.” But that’s not true. Facts First: Trump and Vance’s claims about how tariffs work are false. A tariff is a tax that is paid by US businesses – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. One of the intended goals of a tariff is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, and study after study show that the duties do drive up costs for Americans. Here’s how tariffs work: When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American buyer. “It’s fair to call a tariff a tax because that’s exactly what it is,” said Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. “There’s no way around it. It is a tax on people who buy things from foreign businesses.” Trump has said that if elected, he would impose tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. He also said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar. These duties would add to the tariffs he put on foreign steel and aluminum, washing machines, and many Chinese-made goods including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. President Joe Biden has left many of the Trump-era tariffs in place. A foreign company may choose to pay the tariff or to lower its prices to stay competitive with US-made goods that aren’t impacted by the duty. But study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. Read the full fact check. The Trump campaign may be “goin’ to Wichita” before the November election, but The White Stripes would prefer former President Donald Trump stop traveling with their music as part of his playlist.  Jack and Meg White, formerly of the rock duo The White Stripes, filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York on Monday, accusing Trump and his campaign of “flagrant misappropriation” and copyright infringement of their 2003 song “Seven Nation Army.”  Their complaint, obtained by CNN, states the two musicians “vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by Defendant Trump when he was President and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks,” noting that the song was used without their “knowledge or consent.”  CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign and representatives for Jack White for comment. Last month, White said he would seek legal action after Margo Martin, a deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, shared on social media a since-deleted video of Trump boarding a plane with “Seven Nation Army” playing. In the Whites’ lawsuit, their attorneys write that the defendants “chose to ignore and not respond to Plaintiffs’ pre-litigation efforts to resolve the matters at issue in this action, leaving Plaintiffs with no choice but to seek judicial recourse in order to hold Defendants accountable.” Jack and Meg White are among several artists, including Celine Dion, Foo Fighters and ABBA, who have objected to Trump using their music for his campaign. They are the only living artists to file a lawsuit against Trump in 2024. The estate of soul singer Isaac Hayes also sued the Trump campaign for copyright infringement. Vice President Kamala Harris has so far largely avoided confronting Donald Trump on some of his most racially inflammatory policy proposals — even as she continues to underperform among the Hispanic and Black voters who could face the harshest consequences from the former president’s plans. Not calling out his ideas for the mass deportation of undocumented migrants, for example, or the pressure he wants to put on local governments to adopt tougher policing tactics is a cautious strategy that may reflect the unease in some Democratic circles about bringing attention to the volatile issues of immigration and crime. But it could also deny her some of her best potential tools to pry back some of the Black and Hispanic voters among whom most polls show Trump is still running better than in 2020. Since Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Trump has constantly attempted to portray her as weak on immigration and crime. The former California attorney general has sought to rebut those charges by emphasizing her toughness on those questions — especially her prosecutorial background in a border state — and highlighting Trump’s torpedoing of a bipartisan border deal.  But the real question for many of the groups working on these issues is whether she tries to turn the tables by portraying Trump’s solutions to these problems as extreme, impractical and racially divisive. Gary Segura, a pollster who works with UnidosUS, a leading Hispanic advocacy group that has endorsed Harris, said that the vice president was missing an opportunity by avoiding a confrontation with Trump over his mass deportation plans, for example.

When former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris walk onstage in Philadelphia tonight, it will be their first in-person encounter — a moment each has been mulling as they prepare with advisers for the high-stakes moment. Trump’s approach: Those around Trump tend to stay away from using the word “preparation” when it comes to the debate. In recent weeks, Trump has replicated the informal “policy time” he held with aides ahead of June’s highly consequential face-off with President Joe Biden. Sources say no one has played Harris in a mock debate format, just as no one had previously played Biden. In some sessions, aides have acted as moderators, but more often than not, these conversations serve as briefings with occasional questioning. Trump has, however, enlisted one of the vice president’s ex-rivals: former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who seemed to rattle Harris in tense exchanges during the 2020 Democratic primary. Others helping with policy review included senior advisers Jason Miller and Vince Haley, as well as Stephen Miller. Harris’ approach: The vice president’s team views her as an underdog given Trump’s lengthy experience in general election debates. This will be his seventh total, more than any candidate in history. A stand-in for the former president — wearing his signature red tie — has helped her visualize the scene ahead of time. Harris has engaged in debate prep sessions with a small team of advisers, led by Rohini Kosoglu, a top policy adviser, and Karen Dunn, a longtime Democratic debate specialist. Others involved in preparation sessions include Harris’ White House chief of staff, Lorraine Voles; her campaign chief of staff, Sheila Nix; and Sean Clegg, a veteran strategist. The preparations have included mock debate sessions, with the role of Trump played by Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton who stood in for Trump during Clinton’s own debate prep in 2016.

"Here’s what could happen to inflation, jobs and the deficit if Trump or Harris win | CNN Business","Updated 7:29 AM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-10T09:00:20.762Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/economy/economy-plans-trump-harris/index.html,"In poll after poll, Americans have indicated the economy is their top concern as they prepare to cast votes this election. Dealing with high inflation for years will do that to you. Although inflation has cooled significantly since it peaked at a 40-year high in 2022, Americans are paying around 20% more for goods and services now compared to before the pandemic, according to Consumer Price Index data. On the flip side, the job market, which had been the greatest source of strength in the US economy after the pandemic, has been flashing warning signs lately. The unemployment rate is hovering near three-year highs, and employers are cutting back on hiring, with the number of job openings across the economy recently falling to the lowest level since January 2021, according to the Labor Department. In response to the anxieties Americans have about the economy, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have put vastly different policy proposals on the table, which they’re set to highlight during Tuesday night’s presidential debate. Their contrasting approaches could have far-reaching effects on the economy – and for you. Here’s a look at what could happen to inflation, jobs and the deficit if Trump or Harris win in November. Trump’s tariff policy would controversially charge dramatically higher import taxes on practically everything that comes into the country’s ports from overseas. That could raise revenue for the government — but it could also cause Americans to pay higher prices for goods and services. Goldman Sachs economists estimated that every one percentage point increase in the effective tariff rate could raise core inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index by a tenth of a percentage point. And Trump is talking about 10% to 20% tariffs on most things except Chinese goods — which would get a 60% tariff. Meanwhile, Trump promises to drill a lot more oil, a key cost for many businesses, to bring down prices — but there’s an open question over whether he could achieve that. The United States is already pumping more oil than any nation in history. Additionally, the unprecedented immigration crackdown Trump has vowed if he returns to the White House could also lead to higher inflation, economists say, despite Trump recently asserting prices would “come down dramatically and come down fast” as a result. If mass deportations occur, businesses could struggle to fill open positions, forcing them to raise wages and pass those costs to consumers. Even deporting 1.3 million workers, which is lower than the 10 to 20 million deportations Trump has advocated for, would be an “inflation shock” that lifts inflation by 1.3 percentage points after three years, according to research presented at the Peterson Institute for International Economics by Australian economist Warwick McKibbin. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, would be 2.1 percentage points lower – a dramatic decrease. If 7.5 million workers were deported, inflation would be a staggering 7.4 percentage points higher and GDP would be 12 points lower after three years, the research found. Harris has warned that the immigration system is “broken” and her campaign pledges on its website to bring back the bipartisan border security bill. Yet Harris has not pledged mass deportations or a crackdown anything like what Trump has called for. That’s why Goldman Sachs told clients recently it expected only a “modest further reduction” in net immigration under a Harris presidency. The supply of workers from immigration will be 10,000 per month lower if Trump wins with a divided government than if Harris becomes president, Goldman Sachs estimates. If Republicans sweep in November, Goldman expects America’s supply of workers from immigration would be 30,000 lower than if Harris becomes president. But Harris’ policies aren’t inflation-proof. The first-time homeowner tax credit and tripling of the child tax credit for newborns she’s proposed could leave consumers with more money to spend on goods and services. But as a result, that could increase the prices they pay for them. Harris has also proposed a plan that her team says would result in 3 million housing units. The issue is the timing: If the first-time homebuyer credit goes into effect before more new units are available, it could cause home prices to spike. “The problem right now is too many people chasing too few houses,” said Justin Wolfers, professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, told CNN. “The solution to that is not to give people more money to buy houses. If you don’t fix the supply side, then everyone you helped is hurting someone else.” One potential wildcard for inflation is the two candidates’ different approaches to the Federal Reserve, the independent central bank tasked with controlling inflation. Harris has promised a hands-off approach, while Trump has suggested the president should have influence in decision-making — an argument he later walked back. No matter who wins in November, expect to see the federal budget deficit grow significantly. A budget deficit occurs when the government spends more than the revenue it collects. Currently, the US government is running a $1.5 trillion budget deficit, according to Treasury Department data. The nonpartisan Penn-Wharton Budget Model projects it will increase to $2.1 trillion by 2034 if the status quo is maintained. The size of the deficit has big implications for Americans. The higher the deficit, the riskier it becomes to hold US debt, which tends to grow when the deficit does. As a result, the government could have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money. That can reduce the amount of investment in other programs the government can make. Higher interest rates on government debt, typically sold off in bonds and Treasury notes, could also cause borrowing costs to increase for Americans since the interest rates are connected to interest rates paid to invest in government debt. Several of the tax policies Trump is proposing would substantially limit the amount of money the government collects. Those policies include permanently extending individual and corporate provisions from his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is set to expire next year. That, among other things, would keep the top tax rate individuals pay at 37% compared to 39.6% before it went into effect. He’s also proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 15% versus the current 21% for companies that make products domestically and ending taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors as well as tips for service workers. Trump says he plans to pay for those initiatives with his tariffs. But the revenue the government would collect from the tariffs would not be enough to fully offset the lost tax revenue. The Penn-Wharton Budget Model, which doesn’t take into account new proposals Trump made last week as well as ending taxes on tips, estimates that his proposals could cause the deficit to increase by an additional $5.8 trillion over the next 10 years. The model also doesn’t factor in savings that could come from a commission Trump announced he’d form led by Elon Musk to cut down on wasteful government government spending. Meanwhile, the tax proposals Harris has put forth so far mostly involve imposing higher taxes, which would have a positive impact on the deficit. For instance, she’s endorsed raising the top individual income tax rate to 44.6% and the top long-term capital gains tax rate to 28% versus the current 20%. And on the corporate side, she’s in favor of raising the tax rate to 28%. But the additional tax revenue the government could collect from this could be offset by the hefty tax credits she’s proposed, which include expanding the child tax credit and offering a $25,000 first-time homebuyer credit. And like Trump, she’s promised to end taxes on tips. She’s also pledged not to raise taxes on households making less than $400,000 annually. Both would growon the deficit. Taken together, the Penn Wharton Budget model estimates Harris’ proposals could increase the deficit by an additional $1.2 trillion by 2034. Neither candidate has proposed a credible solution to the country’s fiscal mess, said Joshua Gotbaum, a visiting economics scholar at the Brookings Institution. “But what Harris has proposed would create much less of a mess,” he said."
6 things to watch for when Kamala Harris debates Donald Trump | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:19 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-10T08:00:19.664Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/preview-debate-trump-harris/index.html,"Kamala Harris on Tuesday night faces a task unprecedented in modern political history. On the debate stage in Philadelphia, she will deliver both an opening argument – to the millions of voters who want to know more about her – and a closing argument – for her candidacy and against Donald Trump’s – as their lightning campaign enters its final eight weeks. The former president will also find himself in uncharted waters. After skipping the Republican primary debates, Trump will now square off with his second Democratic rival in as many outings – but unlike President Joe Biden, whose campaign imploded onstage in Atlanta in June, Harris presents a vastly different challenge. Harris has so far enjoyed a charmed campaign. She pounced on the nomination after Biden dropped out in July, then surged – in the polls and on the fundraising front – in the following weeks. Her cash advantage is clear. She raised $361 million in August alone, nearly three times Trump’s haul. But the horse race is as close as ever, and there is increasing demand in the electorate for more information about Harris and her policy agenda – a knowledge gap that creates opportunities and stumbling blocks for both camps. There is less mystery surrounding Trump. This is his record seventh presidential general election debate. On the trail, he has thrown out a typically Trumpian mish-mosh of often self-contradicting pledges and positions, promoted then fled from the now-infamous “Project 2025,” and otherwise sought to tie Harris to Biden’s record, particularly on the border, while frequently issuing gender- and race-baiting personal attacks. The fundamental question ahead of their meeting in Philadelphia, one of the highest-stakes national debates in a generation, is whether – and how – one of them can deliver a compelling message to swing voters while bolstering the confidence of their respective bases. Here are six things to watch for on Tuesday night: Harris has been vice president for nearly four years and spent about the same amount of time before that on Capitol Hill, as California’s junior senator. She ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Still, 28% of likely voters in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll said they needed to know more about her. For Trump, the figure was 9%. More than her convention speech, the debate will provide a platform for Harris to answer some of those questions. So far, she has drilled down with particular focus on two issues: cost of living and reproductive rights. The latter is an obvious place of strength. Her position is vastly more popular than Trump’s and her ability to speak about it is significantly stronger than Biden’s. It also fits neatly into a broader message about personal freedoms. The economy is a stickier wicket. Her campaign has, so far, sought to stay close to what the Biden administration has been preaching while, at the same time, injecting it with a populist freshness that excites Democrats and wins over skeptical undecided voters. And while there’s little reason to expect Harris to deviate from her strategy, which has been to speak in broad terms while rationing specifics, she will be pushed – by the debate moderators and, in his own way, Trump – to provide a clearer picture of how she ranks her priorities. Harris is also likely to be pressed on some recent policy switcharoos. Plastic straws are back in, for example, after she once suggested banning them, while “Medicare for All,” in all its forms, is out. The second Harris presidential campaign has offered a significant correction of the first, an uneven primary bid that flamed out before a vote was cast. So many of the things Harris expressed openness to, if not outright support for, are now off the menu five years later. Where she is now seems both closer politically to Biden and her own long political history. Allies describe it as an evolution, evidence of her open and inquisitive mind. Rivals, led by Trump, tell it differently. To them, Harris’s shifting positions represent a lack of political scruples and an overabundance of ambition. With Trump, goes the familiar argument, the people know where he stands, whether they agree or not. So which narrative will win out Tuesday night? The question is as much for Trump as it is for Harris. The vice president will surely enter with a plan to funnel the expected criticism into a more front-footed message about her plans going forward. The risk there is being seen as disingenuous, in not acknowledging what’s plain to see. Trump, though, has a habit of overplaying a good hand. Staying focused on the specifics would seem the wiser path, given his apparent inability, or refusal, to launch a personal attack not juiced up with outrageous or bigoted language. Trump turned 78 about two weeks before he took the stage with Biden in Georgia. And while the president’s difficulties rightfully dominated the post-debate narrative, Trump, too, appears diminished from his first and second campaigns. Last week, the former president was asked at economic forum if he would “commit to prioritizing legislation to make child care affordable” and, if so, what “specific piece of legislation” he planned to champion. His response was rambling and incomprehensible. (CNN’s Zach Wolf tried his best to make sense of it.) Perhaps worse, it was not an aberration. Trump has for many years spoken in a digressive, unwieldy vernacular. But the digressions have become more frequent and the unwieldiness increasingly difficult to square. Given the manner of Biden’s election exit, it seems likely that the former president’s own words will come under greater scrutiny this time out. The other half of the equation deals with what Trump says when he is, at least in form, speaking clearly. He has already accused Harris, a Howard University graduate and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, of deciding to “turn Black” for political reasons. Trump’s allies are fond of dismissing Harris as a “diversity” hire. Though similar lines might rile up his MAGA base, they play poorly in the suburbs – home to the vast majority of undecided voters – and stiffen the backs (and further open the wallets) of Democrats. For her part, Harris has strained to avoid talk about the “historical nature” of her run, figuring that is self-evident, and in her recent interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, she bypassed a chance to respond to Trump’s bizarre charge. “Same old, tired playbook,” Harris said. “Next question, please.” There is a strong case to be made that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden on the night of their first debate. Belligerent, boisterous and, the country learned shortly thereafter, battling a Covid-19 infection, Trump offered an unflattering parody of himself. Their contest was, of course, close in the end. But no one would deny – well, almost no one – that Trump hurt his chances that night. History in mind, his campaign and Biden’s agreed before their June debate to mute the candidates’ respective microphones when the other was speaking. Trump literally could not interrupt Biden. As it turned out, he had no reason to – the president interrupted himself over and over, often trailing off at the end of his allotted time. Trump, with a few exceptions, did the politically wise thing and let Biden’s words hang in the air. Though she stumbled occasionally on crowded stages during the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, Harris is generally regarded as a sharper debater than even a full-strength Biden. Her campaign’s push to reopen the microphones, ultimately abandoned shortly before the debate date was set, underscored its desire to give Trump the freedom to implode. The interplay between Harris and Trump will be more strictly regulated Tuesday night. How apparent that will be to viewers is something to keep an eye on. By the end of Tuesday night’s debate, the better question might be: Are we sure Biden isn’t still running? A little more than eight weeks since the president left the race, and with precisely eight weeks until the election, Trump’s most consistent argument has been that Harris, for all her talk of turning the page, offers more of the same. When Harris sticks by Biden’s policies, Trump attacks them and her as a failure. How she tries to parry his expected jabs on immigration and the US-Mexico border will be instructive. When Harris seeks to separate herself from her boss, in manner or practice, Trump asks why she didn’t do more over the past four years. For Trump, it’s a simple recipe. Harris has a more complex and – if she manages it successfully – nuanced assignment. What’s not up for debate is that Biden, though absent in person, figures to be a prominent figure on the debate stage. Harris and Trump will use, or try to obscure, his record in service of their own cases – a balancing act that, should one veer too far from the center of political gravity, risks a tumble. Trump has at times boasted of appointing three of the six Supreme Court Justices who voted in 2022 to gut Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion. “I’m proud to have done it,” he once proclaimed. Since then, most Republican-controlled states have imposed either bans or restrictive new laws on the procedure. Some of those efforts were beaten back or overturned by ballot measures organized by abortion rights activists – results that, along with lopsided polling, underscore the unpopularity of the decision and its consequences. Trump was already out of the White House when the high court’s decision came down. Though he did not personally feel the backlash, his party did, most notably underperforming expectations in the 2022 midterms as Democrats railed against the ruling and some Republicans’ determination to implement a broader federal ban. The former president himself has offered a variety of positions and takes on the issue, the most consistent being that abortion policy should be determined by the states. Asked what state policies he supports, Trump has failed to deliver a clear answer. Most recently, he announced he would vote against protecting abortion rights in his adopted home state of Florida, where a ballot measure would wipe out the state’s six-week ban, which Trump also says he opposes. Harris, the former prosecutor, will try to make her rival stake out a clear position. Russian forces have been in Ukraine for more than two-and-a-half years. The fighting has been brutal, recalling the eastern front during World War II. Hamas’ deadly October 7, 2023, raid inside Israel set off a now 11-month-old bombardment of Palestinians in Gaza by the Israeli military. Neither conflict appears near a close as the death tolls grow and the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsens. To hear it from Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin – with whom he claims to have a special friendship – would have never invaded Ukraine if the former president was still in charge, while Israel would be given even freer reign in Gaza than it has enjoyed with Biden in the White House. Because of the diverse, fragile Democratic coalition that she needs to keep onside, Harris, who unreservedly supports continued Western aid to Ukraine, has been less clear on her Middle East plan. Both in her convention speech and on the newly minted “issues” page on her campaign website, Harris has made the case for Israel’s defense, along with the creation of a neighboring Palestinian state, and security for both. Critics say she is cutting the proverbial baby in half. For the first time, though, she will deliver that rhetoric with Trump lying in wait."
"Former Project 2025 director downplays Trump ties, but says he hopes he’d implement the plan | CNN Politics","Published 12:03 AM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-10T04:03:31.446Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/paul-dans-project-2025-trump-cnntv/index.html,"Paul Dans, the former director of the group behind the conservative policy roadmap Project 2025, said on Monday he’s not worried about Vice President Kamala Harris invoking the proposal against Donald Trump in Tuesday’s debate and said he’d like to see the former president implement the plan if he’s returned to the White House. Dans told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins in his first TV interview since stepping down as director in late July that the former president “had nothing to do with” the Heritage Foundation-backed policy playbook forged by dozens of different organizations. But Dans, the former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management under Trump, said he’s been to the former president’s Mar-a-Lago resort on “several” occasions and has met with Trump campaign leadership “from time to time.” He said he’d “shaken hands” with Trump, most recently at a Christian media convention in Tennessee where the former president spoke in February. His comments come as Harris and her allies have sought to link Trump to Project 2025 to portray him as extreme. Democrats have repeatedly pointed to the set of conservative policies as Trump’s and the Republican Party’s roadmap if they return to the White House and control Congress, often highlighting proposals on reproductive health care, prescription drug costs and education policy. The vice president often references to the plan to suggest Trump wants to take the country “back to the past,” while insisting to supporters, “We are not going back.” Trump has repeatedly denied any involvement with Project 2025, saying on Truth Social earlier this year that “some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.” But at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found earlier this year, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership,” the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch. Dans said Trump himself was not involved in crafting the proposal and said the number of former Trump administration employees contributing to the project was an example of “natural” coordination between former colleagues. “(Trump) personally didn’t have anything to do with it. Certainly, a lot of folks, you know, worked on it, came out of the Trump administration. But that’s natural for any Republican administration. You’re going to have the carry over for the next one,” he said. Asked about Trump’s criticism of the plan, Dans said he didn’t know what the former president was specifically referring to. “It was really a coming together of the conservative movement,” Dans said at another point. “Our side’s always been prone to infighting, and what we were able to do here was bring together 110 groups and really lay out a common sense plan.” When asked about his decision to step down as the group’s director – which Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita welcomed with a statement warning groups like Project 2025 not to “misrepresent their influence with President Trump” or “it will not end well for you” – Dans again denied any ties with the Trump campaign but did not respond directly to LaCivita’s warning. “With apologies to Mark Twain, I’d say, you know, the reports about my demise have been greatly exaggerated,” he said. In an interview with The New York Times published Monday, Dans blamed campaign advisers LaCivita and Susie Wiles for their handling of Trump’s campaign in the past few months as Democrats pivoted to supporting Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. “Trump should be running like Secretariat at the Belmont, but instead it’s a race to the wire,” Dans told the Times. Asked by CNN whether he thought Trump’s campaign managers are doing a good job, he told Collins, “I’m excited about the change,” alluding to high-profile additions to Trump’s team, including 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson."
Analysis: Harris braces for the most critical moment of her political career at debate with Trump | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 AM EDT, Tue September 10, 2024",2024-09-10T04:00:19.309Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/harris-crucial-test-debate-analysis/index.html,"Kamala Harris’ joyful campaign will Tuesday be hit by the blunt force of reality — a debate with Donald Trump — the most menacing political foe of modern times. The vice president transformed the 2024 election after President Joe Biden’s abject debate showing against Trump on CNN in June led him to end his reelection bid. She restored several swing states to the electoral battlefield and has had Democrats dreaming of a stunning turnabout in a race most thought they were well on the way to losing. Yet her success in unifying her party, branding herself as a fresh voice of generational change and closing into a dead heat with Trump in polling has so far not cemented a reliable path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Indeed, if the election were on Tuesday, the ex-president, who has already defied an assassination attempt and scores of criminal charges, could still win. Presidential debates usually don’t decide elections — notwithstanding the cataclysmic impact of Biden’s wipeout. But Tuesday night represents the best remaining chance for Harris to drive home a decisive argument that could thwart Trump’s historic comeback. Her assignment in Philadelphia will require the use of rhetorical skills that have been often questioned in an uneven vice presidency. While she has had her moments in debates and Senate hearings, Harris has sometimes struggled to articulate clear policies and answers under pressure in spontaneous situations. Her willingness to submit to only one major media interview since becoming the Democratic nominee, on CNN last month, has only raised the bar for her performance in what is so far the only scheduled debate with Trump. And while the former president has now taken part in presidential debates in three separate elections, this will be Harris’ first venture onto the debate stage since her meeting with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. As she seeks to become the first Black woman and South Asian president, Harris will come into close quarters for the first time with a rival who will do anything to win and who has a history of using racial and gendered tropes for political gain. Trump has questioned her intelligence and race as a Black woman and has amplified a sexual innuendo about her on social media. But the vice president seems determined not to be drawn into his traps. She refused in her CNN interview to address Trump’s race-based rhetoric, dismissing it as the “same old, tired playbook” and adding, “Next question, please.” Harris has far less top-level political experience than either 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton or Biden when they confronted Trump in presidential debates. And even some members of her own party didn’t believe that she was the strongest potential Democratic leader for a post-Biden era. But on Tuesday, Harris has a chance to change perceptions about her political acumen and to put down a marker for the sprint to November 5. A campaign that has been about avoiding error and limiting unscripted public exposure for the vice president faces a nowhere-to-hide moment on prime-time television. And the price of failure is enormous — as it could put a strongman ex-president, who tried to subvert US democracy after the 2020 election, on the road to a new presidency devoted to “retribution.” The stakes for Democrats were emphasized on Saturday when Trump vowed in a social media post to prosecute and jail election officials, political opponents, donors and others who he suggests will have “cheated” in the election, as he made yet more untrue accusations that his 2020 loss was the result of voter fraud. Still, if Harris can withstand the pressure and stare down the onslaught from Trump, the debate offers her significant opportunities — potentially more than those open to Trump, who’s already a love-him-or-hate-him known quantity. A successful performance on Tuesday night could establish a platform for the vice president to convince undecided voters in critical swing states that she has credible plans to improve their lives. A New York Times/Siena College poll released this weekend hinted at the possibilities for her to grow, finding that 28% of likely voters wanted to learn more about the vice president, whereas only 9% thought the same of the Republican nominee. Harris has clearly been thinking about how to win over those voters. She has, for example, shown more concern for their economic challenges than Biden, whose defensive statements on the unevenness of the post-pandemic recovery became a liability. Harris has vowed to crack down on what she says is “price gouging” on groceries, says she wants to help first-time home buyers with up to $25,000 in downpayment support and wants to make rent more affordable. And in a broader sense, she is offering voters a chance to avoid the chaos, bitterness and political turbulence that raged in Trump’s first term and that his increasingly wild statements suggest would only intensify in a second. But to succeed in the debate, the vice president faces three difficult tasks. — She must find a balance between rebutting what her campaign expects to be a gusher of attacks and falsehoods from Trump and emphasizing her message. “I think he’s going to lie and he has a playbook that he has used in the past, be it, you know, his attacks on President Obama or Hillary Clinton,” Harris said in a radio interview on “The Rickey Smiley Morning Show” released on Monday. “What I intend to point out is what we – so many people – know, and certainly, as I’m traveling the country in this campaign, he tends to fight for himself, not for the American people.” — Harris must also neutralize the underlying contradiction of her campaign — that she’s running as an agent of change and renewal despite being part of an unpopular administration that Trump blames for many of the problems that she is promising to fix, including high prices for groceries and housing. In a related challenge, Harris must try to make up ground on Biden on two issues that voters say are most important to them and on which she usually trails Trump in polls: management of the economy and immigration. Trump has struggled to make effective arguments against Harris since she joined the race, but in its searing advertising campaigns, his team has accused her and Biden of causing the economic issues hurting the middle class. As Trump’s team put it in a memo on Monday, “As the chief cheerleader for Bidenomics, she needs to convince voters how Bidenomics is working despite everything being significantly more expensive than under President Trump.” — Harris will also need to find a way to parry Trump’s certain accusations that she has flip flopped on policies that she backed during her short-lived Democratic primary run in 2019, including on fracking and the border. In seeking to explain these shifts in the CNN interview, Harris told Dana Bash that while she may have modified her approaches, her “values have not changed.” She argued, for instance, that she now believed it was possible to fight the climate crisis without banning the environmentally damaging practice of fracking, seeking to finesse her position on an issue that could hurt her in battleground Pennsylvania. The conceit, however, allowed the Trump campaign to argue she’d return to her original stance if she won power. The former president’s team has made no attempt to hide its disdain for Harris’ political skills and clearly believes that her performance will come closer to her stumbles early in her vice presidency than her assured, but scripted, showing at the Democratic convention. Trump, for instance, insisted last week, “I’m going to let her talk.” That was among the milder rhetoric the former president has aimed at Harris as he’s tried to further raise the heat on his rival. But Anita Dunn, a former senior Biden adviser who helped prepare the president for the June debate, said the new Democratic nominee would be ready for anything Trump throws at her. “He will say anything – that is actually the hurdle – not to go down those rabbit holes,” Dunn told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “He will say anything – it may not make sense; it may be totally incoherent, but he will say it with a lot of authority. And so, making sure you know what your game plan is, what you want to say to the American people, is key,” Dunn added. “I believe the vice president will be fully prepared to do that.”"
Trump accuser said she ‘laughed out loud’ when she heard him again deny her assault allegation | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:52 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-10T01:41:49.025Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/jessica-leeds-donald-trump-cnntv/index.html,"Jessica Leeds, who previously accused Donald Trump of sexual assault and was a trial witness in a high-profile case against the former president, said Monday that she “laughed out loud” when she heard he recently disputed her allegation and said she “would not have been the chosen one.” “I laughed out loud. I couldn’t believe that he was using that word like some sort of cult figure,” Leeds told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360.” Leeds was one of the first women to come forward during the 2016 presidential campaign to allege that Trump sexually assaulted her. She said she was seated in first class on an airplane next to Trump in the 1970s when he suddenly began groping her. Leeds said she fought off Trump and moved to the back of the airplane. “I was not the first, of course I was not the last. But there have been enough so that he doesn’t remember,” Leeds told Cooper Monday. Asked about Leeds’ comments, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung again denied Trump had ever met Leeds and said that “whatever fable she’s trying to peddle is only meant to interfere in the election and distract from” Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival. Leeds had been called to testify during Trump’s sexual abuse and defamation trial last year brought by E. Jean Carroll, who accused the former president of assaulting her in a luxury department store dressing room in the spring of 1996. She was one of two women Carroll’s lawyers called to allege Trump had a modus operandi of sexually assaulting women and then attacking their appearance and credibility when the allegations became public. A jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation when in 2019 he denied Carroll’s allegation, said she wasn’t his type, and claimed that she made up the assault to sell copies of a book. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million in damages. Trump is appealing the verdict. During oral arguments before a panel of judges on Friday, Trump’s attorneys questioned the admissibility of Leeds’ testimony, claiming it wasn’t a federal crime in the 1970s to sexually abuse a woman on an airplane. Carroll’s lawyer said “simple assault” was illegal on an airplane at the time. Trump, following the hearing, lashed out at Leeds and several other women who have accused him of sexual assault, saying her claim was a “totally made up story” and said she was a “big Clinton person.” “Now, I assume she’ll sue me now for defamation, like I got sued by E. Jean Carroll,” the former president said. Leeds, addressing reporters at a news conference in front of Trump Tower earlier Monday, said that “it’s important to remind the voters of Trump’s disrespect of women,” adding: “He assaulted me 50 years ago and continues to attack me today.” Asked by Cooper whether she’ll pursue legal action against Trump related to his latest comments, Leeds said that “we’re leaving all of our options open.” “But no, my goal when I was asked to testify at E. Jean’s trial was to establish that this is his behavior, longstanding, and I have nothing to gain from it,” she said. Earlier this year a separate jury found Trump defamed Carroll when in 2022 he repeated several of the statements he initially made in 2019. The jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million. Her attorneys argued to the jury that the only way to stop Trump from repeating the statements was to hit him in his pocketbook."
Donald Glover postpones Childish Gambino tour stops to ‘focus on my physical health’ | CNN,"Published 7:53 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T23:53:41.771Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/entertainment/donald-glover-childish-gamino-tour-postponed/index.html,"Donald Glover is postponing the remaining North American dates of his final tour under the moniker Childish Gambino due to health-related reasons, he announced on Monday. “Unfortunately i have to postpone the rest of the north american tour to focus on my physical health for a few weeks,” Glover wrote in a statement posted to his X page. “Thanks for the privacy. thanks for the support. thanks for the love.” Glover also wrote that ticket holders should hold onto their tickets because they will be honored for the rescheduled dates, which have not yet been announced. The North American leg of the tour was set to conclude on October 3 in Chicago. The tour is then set to head to Europe in November. CNN reached out to a representative for Glover for comment. Glover previously announced that Sunday’s concert in Houston was also being postponed “due to illness” and had rescheduled a concert in August, citing “production issues.” In June, Glover revealed that he was going to soon retire his musical persona Childish Gambino, telling the New York Times in an interview that it was :not fulfilling.” The actor and musician released his fifth and final Childish Gambino album titled “Bando Stone & the New World” in July."
The White Stripes sue Trump campaign over use of ‘Seven Nation Army’ | CNN,"Published 7:18 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T23:18:17.133Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/entertainment/jack-white-meg-white-trump-seven-nation-army/index.html,"The Trump campaign may be “goin’ to Wichita” before the November election, but The White Stripes would prefer former President Donald Trump stop traveling with their music as part of his playlist. Jack and Meg White, formerly of the rock duo The White Stripes, filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York on Monday, accusing Trump and his campaign of “flagrant misappropriation” and copyright infringement of their 2003 song “Seven Nation Army.” Their complaint, obtained by CNN, states the two musicians “vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by Defendant Trump when he was President and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks,” noting that the song was used without their knowledge or consent.” CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign and representatives for Jack White for comment. The two artists stopped performing together as The White Stripes in 2011. Last month, Jack White said he would seek legal action after Margo Martin, a deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, shared on social media a since-deleted video of Trump boarding a plane with “Seven Nation Army” playing. In the Whites’ lawsuit, their attorneys write that the defendants “chose to ignore and not respond to Plaintiffs’ pre-litigation efforts to resolve the matters at issue in this action, leaving Plaintiffs with no choice but to seek judicial recourse in order to hold Defendants accountable.” Jack and Meg White are among several artists who have objected to Trump using their music for his campaign, including Celine Dion, Foo Fighters and ABBA. They are the only living artists to file a lawsuit against Trump in 2024. The estate of soul singer Isaac Hayes also sued the Trump campaign for copyright infringement. Last week, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction for the Trump campaign on further use of the song “Hold On, I’m Coming,” marking the first time a court has ordered Trump to stop using particular music, despite artists’ public objections, this election cycle."
Analysis: Why playing it safe on immigration and crime could be a big risk for Harris | CNN Politics,"Published 7:11 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T23:11:07.528Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/harris-trump-immigration-crime-analysis/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris has so far largely avoided confronting Donald Trump on some of his most racially inflammatory policy proposals – even as she continues to underperform among the Hispanic and Black voters who could face the harshest consequences from the former president’s plans. Not calling out his ideas for the mass deportation of undocumented migrants, for example, or the pressure he wants to put on local governments to adopt tougher policing tactics is a cautious strategy that may reflect the unease in some Democratic circles about bringing attention to the volatile issues of immigration and crime. But it could also deny her some of her best potential tools to pry back some of the Black and Hispanic voters among whom most polls show Trump is still running better than in 2020. Since Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Trump has constantly attempted to portray her as weak on immigration and crime. The former California attorney general has sought to rebut those charges by emphasizing her toughness on those questions – especially her prosecutorial background in a border state – and highlighting Trump’s torpedoing of a bipartisan border deal. But the real question for many of the groups working on these issues is whether she tries to turn the tables by portraying Trump’s solutions to these problems as extreme, impractical and racially divisive. Gary Segura, a pollster who works with UnidosUS, a leading Hispanic advocacy group whose sister organization UnidosUS Action Fund  has endorsed Harris, said that the vice president was missing an opportunity by avoiding a confrontation with Trump over his mass deportation plans, for example. “We have done focus groups and polling both for Unidos and for other organizations [and] overwhelmingly mass deportation is not a popular position,” among Hispanics, Segura told reporters last week while releasing a new Unidos national survey of Hispanic voters. “But it is not particularly well known. Many of the people we speak to believe he will do it if he can, but they just don’t actually believe that he can pull that off.” On both immigration and crime, Trump this year is running on an agenda significantly more aggressive than he proposed either in 2020 or 2016. In effect, Trump is gambling that he can energize his base of culturally conservative White voters with these hardline ideas, while also attracting an increased share of non-White voters on other issues, starting with the economy. The reluctance of the Harris campaign, and the leading Democratic interest groups, to confront Trump more directly over his proposals is increasing the odds that gamble will pay off. Among the immigration issues that Harris and liberal groups supporting her have almost completely ignored are Trump’s pledge to implement a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants; his call to end birthright citizenship for the children of those immigrants; and his refusal to rule out reviving his policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border (which his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on Friday also suggested could be reprised). In his Wisconsin campaign rally on Saturday, Trump warned that deporting at least some of the migrants he intends to target “will be a bloody story.” Democrats have also said little about Trump’s suite of aggressive crime policy proposals. These including mandating that local police departments adopt “stop and frisk” tactics as a condition of receiving federal law enforcement aid, while simultaneously passing federal legislation making it more difficult to sue police officers for misconduct. (He touted those ideas again last Friday when receiving the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police.) Trump has also talked openly about deploying the National Guard into high-crime cities over the objections of local governors and mayors. These programs’ cumulative impact on minority communities could be enormous. Trump has repeatedly promised to pursue “the Largest Domestic Deportation Operation in History,” as he has phrased it on social media. Stephen Miller, Trump’s top immigration adviser, has publicly discussed plans to build a massive deportation force composed of federal law enforcement officials from a wide array of agencies, local police and sheriff’s departments, and even National Guard troops provided by sympathetic red state governors, to “go around the country arresting illegal immigrants in large-scale raids.” Undocumented migrants, Miller continued, would then be transferred to massive internment camps – “large-scale staging grounds near the border, most likely in Texas” – from which they would returned to their home countries through near-constant flights. Deportations at even a fraction of the pace Trump is promising could be enormously disruptive to the Hispanic community and the broader economy. Michael Ettlinger, the founding director of the University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy, wrote last week in the Boston Globe that mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could remove from the workforce 22% of all farmworkers, 15% of construction workers, and 8% of both manufacturing and service workers, including child care providers. Economic forecasters at groups such as Moody’s Analytics and Goldman Sachs have cited that potential disruption to the labor force as a key factor in their projections that Trump’s agenda would reignite inflation and slow domestic growth. Simultaneously, widespread deportations could touch millions of Hispanics beyond those here illegally. According to unpublished new research provided to CNN, Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center, estimates that about 15 million Hispanics, or roughly one-fourth of the entire US Hispanic population, live in so called “mixed status” families, where at least some members are undocumented. Those 15 million people divide roughly equally between those who are here illegally and those who are legal residents – including nearly 4 million US-born citizen children of undocumented parents, Passel calculates. The implications of Trump’s criminal justice agenda are nearly as sweeping. In one of his “Agenda 47” videos outlining his second-term plans, Trump said he “will require local law enforcement agencies receiving [federal] grants to return to proven policing measures such as stop-and-frisk.” That refers to the policy, instituted most aggressively in New York City under Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, of stopping large numbers of people to search for drugs or guns; eventually a federal judge ruled the program violated the rights of minorities, who were disproportionately targeted in the stops, and the city abandoned the policy. Black and Hispanic young men between the ages of 14-24 accounted for over 40% of all those stopped under the policy, even though they account for less than 5% of city residents, according to a report by the NYCLU. Advocates for police reform say that requiring cities to implement some version of the stop-and-frisk approach while also passing federal legislation strengthening the “qualified immunity,” which protects police against lawsuits over misconduct (as Trump has also promised), would inevitably result in many more arrests of young Black and brown men each year. “If that is something cities take on across the country … there will be millions of [more] police stops,” mostly of younger Black and Latino men, said Ed Chung, vice-president for initiatives of Vera Action, a group that advocates for policing reform. “And if the numbers hold true to what the New York Police Department experienced, 90% of those will be stops for no reason.” Yet despite these potentially massive impacts, Trump’s immigration and criminal justice ideas have received relatively little attention in the campaign from anyone – the media, liberal interest groups or the Harris campaign. Harris did not mention the threat of mass deportation in either Phoenix or Las Vegas, two cities with very large Hispanic populations, when she appeared in them on her initial campaign swing with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. And while, in all her stump speeches, she alludes to the prospect that Trump’s proposed tariffs will inflate prices, she pointedly omits any mention of the mass deportation program that economists consider an equal inflationary risk. On Friday, Harris also chose not to mention mass deportation during a radio interview with Univision, when the host asked her to summarize her argument to undecided Hispanic voters. Nor has Harris criticized Trump’s plans to pressure cities to implement tougher policing policies, even when she’s appeared in cities with large Black populations, such as Philadelphia, Atlanta and Savannah. The Harris campaign, based on my conversations with people familiar with its thinking, has not engaged in these fights largely because it believes that the remaining minority voters up for grabs are mostly motivated by the same economic concerns as the White electorate. It wants Harris to be seen primarily as focusing on those bread-and-butter concerns. To the extent Democrats want to highlight some of Trump’s more extreme ideas, the campaign believes that work could be done more usefully either by surrogates, paid advertising, or groups in the broader Democratic universe – rather than Harris personally engaging the former president, according to the sources familiar with the campaign’s strategy. Still a growing number of Democratic activists focused on rallying Black and Latino voters are clearly eager to hear Harris and other party leaders challenge the Trump agenda more directly. “There is a way in which those [crime and immigration] issues in particular are also about bigger things,” said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a group working to mobilize Black voters for Harris and Democrats. “They are about values. There is a way to talk about them that is fundamentally about who are we and who do we want to be as nation, which she is really good at. People are quite tired of being the worst version of ourselves, and I think that contrast is really important to make.” Segura, the pollster who works with UnidosUS, said that while a measurable segment of the Hispanic electorate supports hardline approaches on immigration they tend to be “the voters who lean in the GOP direction in the first place.” As a result, he added, “I don’t see a lot of risk” for Harris to push back against Trump’s deportation plans “particularly in targeted advertising to Hispanic voters.” Tom Wong, founding director of the US Immigration Policy Center at the University of California at San Diego, has tested public opinion on mass deportation for another immigration advocacy group, America’s Voice. Wong said that while mass deportation initially draws substantial public backing, support for the idea dwindles both among Hispanics and the broader population when people are informed that such a program could sweep up people who have been in the US for years without breaking the law and may have US citizen children. “Once we can put a human face on the idea of an undocumented immigrant being rounded up and deported, then the general public takes a step back,” Wong said. A national poll by Marquette Law School in Wisconsin earlier this year confirmed that dynamic. A May survey found that when part of the sample was asked, “Do you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?” over three-fifths said they did. But that support flipped to majority opposition among another group of respondents who were asked if they would support deportations even of people who “have lived here for a number of years, have jobs and no criminal record.” Raising the prospect of the detention camps that would be required for mass deportation may also depress support for the idea. New polling released last week by the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute found that over three-fifths of all Americans opposed deporting all undocumented immigrants “even if it takes setting up encampments guarded by the US military.” Fully 7-in-10 Hispanics said they opposed that idea, according to unpublished results provided to CNN. Not as much public polling is available on the specifics of Trump’s policing agenda. But Daniela Gilbert, director of Vera’s Redefining Public Safety initiative, says that the group’s private surveys consistently show widespread public backing for a comprehensive agenda of providing support to police departments, but also insisting on accountability for police misconduct and promoting alternative approaches to community safety, such as greater mental health intervention and drug treatment. That’s largely the mix of policies the Biden administration has advanced, Gilbert noted. “Our polling data really shows that Harris will leave votes on the table if her campaign is silent on the need for better and more accountable policing,” Gilbert said. “Talking about those policies can garner more support, whether or not that is framed in direct response to Trump’s outlandish policies, or really focused on the track record she has in advocating for greater accountability.” Anthony Baber, director of communications and culture at Detroit Action, a grassroots group that mobilizes working-class and younger voters of color in that city, points to another reason for Harris to amplify the volume on these issues. He said her emphasis on her prosecutorial background has caused some of the voters of color the group is trying to reach to question the distance between her and Trump on issues relating to criminal justice. Harris, Baber believes, needs to more clearly separate herself from Trump on that front. “Trump is kind of benefiting from the perception of Harris as the super cop,” Baber said. “I think there’s a lot of people who see [her history as a prosecutor] and wonder if [she] is a more compassionate candidate when it comes to criminal justice reform, because it is not coming through as clearly as a difference between these two candidates.” Harris nonetheless has plenty of reasons to minimize her exchanges with Trump around immigration and crime. Some Democratic strategists agree with the campaign assessment she has a better chance to reach the non-White voters now considering Trump by emphasizing economic messages rather than the threat he could pose to them on these issues. Polls also consistently show that many more voters trust Trump than Harris on immigration – he led her by double-digits on the issue in all six of the swing states in CNN’s survey last week. She’s narrowed Biden’s overall deficit to Trump on trust to handle crime. But among White voters, she trailed Trump by at least 22 points on immigration in all of the states CNN polled except Michigan and Wisconsin, where she trailed more narrowly; on crime, she trailed him by at least 17 points with Whites everywhere except those two states, where again she trailed more narrowly. Given those deficits, some of the activists focused on Black and Hispanic voters believe the party has concluded that any time spent talking about immigration or crime is a net negative for them – even if they are trying to focus attention on Trump’s controversial responses. To the extent Harris and other Democrats are addressing these issues at all, many of these activists believe, they are emphasizing a message of toughness rather than equity. “I think that Democrats have been scared away [from] talking about immigration because of the record numbers of arrivals at the southern border,” said Wong, alluding to the high number of border crossings late last year that fed GOP attacks on the Biden administration but have since markedly decreased. Chung of Vera Action similarly says that the increase in crime around the pandemic – which has since largely receded – has discouraged not only Democratic office-holders but the broader constellation of progressive groups from more forcefully pushing alternatives to hardline policing policies. Harris has also repeatedly signaled that she does not want to focus the campaign on issues that revolve around race – as she did when she immediately shut down any discussion of Trump’s attempt to question her racial identity during her recent interview with Dana Bash on CNN. “I think a lot of issues that could be really resonant among historically Democratic constituencies, like younger African Americans and Hispanics, they seem to be worried more about alienating more conservative Whites in places like Pennsylvania,” said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Against all of these reasons for Harris to sidestep these fights, there remains the stubborn reality that, despite her own gains, she still typically polls below Biden’s 2020 level of support among Hispanic and Black voters. And many of those voters might recoil from these Trump policies on crime and immigration if they heard more about them. Shropshire of BlackPAC said that in her group’s polling, the hardline approaches to policing and deportation that Trump is touting “do not align with the values of any of the voters that he is trying to move” in the Black community. “What he is hoping is that the Black voters who he is [courting] don’t see that stuff,” Shropshire said. Like the campaign advisers I spoke with, Shropshire adds, “It should not just be the onus of the vice president to call this out. There is an entire Democratic ecosystem that should be addressing these things.” Given Harris’ persistent need to recover more ground with Hispanic and Latino voters, the riskiest choice for her and her allies on immigration and crime might be to continue to play it safe.

Here’s what the conversation around Harris and Trump looks like among Americans ahead of the debate | CNN Politics,"Published 6:16 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T22:16:06.810Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/breakthrough-polling-project-harris-trump-august/index.html,"Across the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s presidential debate, the news Americans have been hearing, reading and seeing about Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump has continued shuffling, with the topics that resonate about each candidate shifting week to week. That’s a change from the past two presidential campaigns. Results of similar surveys in 2016 and 2020 found that the news and information that broke through to Americans about at least one candidate in those elections were consistently dominated by one issue throughout the course of the campaign – emails around Hillary Clinton in 2016 and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic for Trump in 2020. This time around, there hasn’t been any such dominant issue for either candidate since CNN began tracking these results in mid-June. That’s the key takeaway from the latest round of data from The Breakthrough, a collaborative research project from CNN, the University of Michigan and Georgetown University, conducted by research firms SSRS and Verasight. The surveys, which collect responses from a new group of roughly 1,000 representative Americans each week, run each Friday through Monday. Data collected around the time of the Democratic National Convention showed the party’s gathering driving the campaign conversation around Harris that week, with those reporting they had heard about the Democratic conclave using more positive words about it than those who’d heard about the Republican Party’s convention in July had done at the time. And through the Labor Day weekend, discussion of Harris focused largely on the interview she did with CNN, her first major sit-down since becoming the Democratic nominee for president. For Trump, by contrast, the most recent data reveals a spike in mentions of news about his appearance at Arlington National Cemetery, during which his campaign ignored a cemetery official’s calls not to film the former president in a section that is reserved for those who lost their lives in recent military action. Mentions of “abortion” also crack the top five for Trump this week, the only policy-related word to do so since the survey began, aside from mentions of “Project 2025” in mid-July. The spike in responses around a single topic marks a departure from recent trend around Trump in the Breakthrough data. The conversation around Trump’s campaign in the time after his party’s convention in mid-July and up through the end of the Democratic convention in late August was notable for its lack of a dominant theme or focus on a single new development. Americans reporting they had heard about Trump’s campaign were using a range of words, with the most common focused on the day-to-day of a presidential run. There were roughly twice as many mentions of “Arlington” alone in the most recent data as there were mentions in the preceding week of “campaign,” that week’s most commonly used word. These campaign-related words are still a frequent feature of Americans’ reports about what they’ve heard about Trump, but in the most recent data, they are joined by news about his Arlington visit. In survey data collected in the days after the Democratic convention, 25% of respondents mentioned something related to Trump’s campaign activity, with the next most frequently mentioned topic (opinions about Trump) at 9% of all mentions. In the most recent data, 24% mention something related to campaigning, with 17% saying something that touches on the Arlington visit or the controversy around it. Overall sentiment in Americans’ reports of what they have seen, read or heard about each of the candidates has been consistently more positive for Harris than for Trump, though for both, recent trends suggest at least somewhat more negative sentiment than positive. Over the past two weeks, Harris’ numbers climbed into net positive territory around the DNC and then settled back to their pre-convention level in the week after. Harris appears to have received a larger boost on this metric from the Democratic convention in Chicago than Trump did from the Republican gathering in Milwaukee. Comparing the data collected shortly after the DNC with that collected just after the Republican National Convention, there is a notable difference in tone overall. While the bulk of the responses mentioning that someone had heard something about each convention were neutral, those who did express a sentiment were far more positive toward Harris after the DNC than they were toward Trump after the RNC. News about Trump’s convention was largely overshadowed in the public’s view by news about the assassination attempt against him shortly before the convention began: 61% of respondents mentioned that in the week after Trump’s convention, compared with 23% who mentioned something about the convention. For Harris, though, the convention was by far the most frequently mentioned topic of its moment: About 40% of respondents mentioned something convention-related, nearly twice as much as the next most frequently cited topic that week, her campaign at 21%. Around 7 in 10 Americans in the most recent poll reported hearing some news about each of the two major candidates, about the same as during each of the previous two weeks. The upcoming debate could prompt a shift in those numbers though: Shortly after the first presidential debate in late June, the share reporting that they had heard something about Trump climbed from 77% to 83%, with the share saying they’d heard news about Joe Biden rising from 71% to 83%. (Biden dropped out of the race the following month and endorsed Harris.) That latest data also marks a spike in attention to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as he ended his independent bid for the presidency and threw his support behind Trump. Over the past two weeks, about 6 in 10 Americans reported having heard something about Kennedy, higher than at any point since The Breakthrough began tracking impressions of the race in late June. Overall, 61% said they had heard something about Kennedy in the most recent week, 20 points above his pre-dropout high mark of 41%. Demonstrating the limited impact his campaign had on the national conversation around the presidential race, over the entire course of the survey, there were more mentions of dropping out for Kennedy than any other word."
Gaza hostage families urge Trump and Harris to bring Americans home | CNN,"Published 5:26 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T21:26:44.723Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/middleeast/gaza-hostage-families-presidential-debate-intl-latam/index.html,"Ahead of a key US presidential debate this week, families of several American hostages held in Gaza are calling on US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to offer new ideas for securing the immediate release of their loved ones. “We want to hear that they care. We want to hear that both candidates understand and acknowledge there are seven Americans still in captivity, and that the US is fully committed to bringing them back,” Ronen Neutra, a US-Israeli dual citizen from New York, told CNN. His 22-year-old son, Omer, is a serving Israeli soldier and was abducted by Hamas during the October 7 attacks. CNN spoke with relatives of three US citizens held in Gaza who all expressed frustration that attempts to free their family members over the past 11 months had so far failed. “Enough is enough,” said Adi Alexander, whose 20-year-old son Edan was serving in the Israeli military when he was abducted by Hamas on October 7. “Perhaps the deal proposed by President (Joe) Biden back in December was good then, but maybe we need something different now,” he added. All the family members who spoke to CNN said they were looking to the Biden administration as well as Trump and Harris to find creative ways to increase pressure on Hamas and Israel to reach a new deal. “I would challenge the candidates and ask them, you know, how to get our kids back,” said Ruby Chen, another US-Israeli citizen whose 19-year-old son, Itay, was killed during the attacks last year. His body is still being held by Hamas in Gaza. “We want to hear new ideas from both candidates and for them to commit to adopting a fresh approach to all the players,” Chen told CNN. The family members told CNN that approach should include the US seeking new pressure points on Hamas and its sponsor Iran, as well as on other nations with potential influence, like Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, the Gulf state which hosts Hamas officials and has helped facilitate negotiations. Incentives, such as trade deals, sanctions relief and international prisoner swaps should also be evaluated, the hostage families told CNN, similar to recent deals agreed between Washington and Moscow to free US citizens such as Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and US basketball star Brittney Griner “They showed great creativity in a complex deal they did for Evan Gershkovich and working an international deal with Germany and other countries to bring American citizens back home,” Alexander told CNN. “Our children may be not as famous as a basketball player, but you know, from our perspective, the creativity they have shown has to come back again here in our case, and to do everything possible, everything within their means – whether it’s putting more pressure, whether it’s finding creative ways to bring our kids back home.” There is even support among the relatives of the US hostages for Washington to apply greater pressure on Israel, whose veteran prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is accused by critics of thwarting US-led hostage negotiations to appease hardliners in his fragile coalition. The relatives said they would now support moves to curb US diplomatic, financial and military aid to Israel as a way of pushing Netanyahu toward a deal. “Without a doubt, more pressure on Bibi Netanyahu should be placed, but I’m not sure there is political will at this point, either from the Biden administration or the Trump campaign, to put more light between them and the Israeli prime minister,” Ronen Neutra told CNN, using a popular nickname for Netanyahu. “But we are urging our leaders to take brave action and to put politics aside. We are not playing here. This is a real life-and-death situation,” he added. Over 100 hostages remain in Gaza today, as living conditions in the Palestinian enclave crumble under Israeli forces’ months-long siege. Freed hostages have described suffering from frequent shortages of food and water in Gaza, and some have also reported physical and mental abuse by their captors. The recovery earlier this month of six murdered hostages’ bodies prompted mass protests in Israel, with demonstrators demanding Netanyahu’s government strike a deal to free those who remained in captivity. Many wondered if the nationwide outrage might be enough to force his hand. Instead, a defiant Netanyahu has doubled down on his strategy in the strip, stressing his commitment to fighting until Hamas is defeated and repeating his refusal to withdraw soldiers from the border between Gaza and Egypt – a significant new sticking point in talks to reach a deal."
Fact check: Trump and Vance keep falsely describing how tariffs work | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:00 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T16:45:56.877Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/fact-check-trump-vance-tariffs/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance continue to falsely describe how one of their major policy proposals, across-the-board tariffs, would work. Trump has falsely, and repeatedly, claimed that China – not US importers – pay the tariff. At a rally in Arizona in mid-August, he claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, is lying when she refers to his tariff plan as a “Trump tax.” “She is a liar. She makes up crap … I am going to put tariffs on other countries coming into our country, and that has nothing to do with taxes to us. That is a tax on another country,” Trump said. In September, he repeated the claim during an interview with Fox News: “It’s not a tax on the middle class. It’s a tax on another country.” And he said again during a rally in Wisconsin Saturday that “it’s not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country.” Vance said in late August that as a result of tariffs Trump imposed during his presidency, “prices went down for American citizens.” “They went up for the Chinese but they went down for our people,” Vance added. But that’s not true. Facts First: Trump and Vance’s claims about how tariffs work are false. A tariff is a tax that is paid by US businesses – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. One of the intended goals of a tariff is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, and study after study show that the duties do drive up costs for Americans. Here’s how tariffs work: When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American buyer. “It’s fair to call a tariff a tax because that’s exactly what it is,” said Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. “There’s no way around it. It is a tax on people who buy things from foreign businesses,” she added. Trump has said that if elected, he would impose tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. He also said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar. These duties would add to the tariffs he put on foreign steel and aluminum, washing machines, and many Chinese-made goods including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. President Joe Biden has left many of the Trump-era tariffs in place. It’s possible that a foreign company chooses to pay the tariff or to lower its prices to stay competitive with US-made goods that aren’t impacted by the duty. But study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. To date, Americans have paid more than $242 billion to the US Treasury for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods, according to US Customs and Border Protection. Once an American importing company pays the tariff to the US Treasury, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it along to the buyer of its goods – whether that’s a retailer or a consumer. For example, American shoe seller Deer Stags, which imports most of its product line from China, decided to do a little bit of both. It was harder to get customers to pay more for existing styles that Deer Stags had carried for a long time, president Rick Muskat told CNN. So the company ended up eating the cost of the tariffs placed on some older styles and charging more for some new items. There are many factors that can affect a retailer’s decision to raise prices on some items and not others. Some goods affected by Trump’s tariffs saw “sharp price increases,” but overall, the tariffs’ impact on retail prices “is more mixed,” one study published in 2019 found. “Somebody in the United States has to pay this tax,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “If it’s not consumers, it’s going to be companies. And if it’s companies that pay it, ultimately, the cost is going to be borne, by some degree, by workers,” he said. Even though the full cost of the tariff may not be passed from the retailer to the consumer, there’s widespread consensus among economists that some prices do rise for consumers due to tariffs. For example, the median price of washing machines in the US rose by about $86 – or nearly 12% – after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made ones, according to a study published in 2019. The researchers also found that the price of dryers – which were not impacted by tariffs – but are usually sold in a package with washing machines – also increased by 12%, or about $92 per unit. Together, the price increases cost consumers more than $1.5 billion during the first year the tariffs were in place. The duties expired in 2023. A US International Trade Commission study published last year confirmed that prices went up for consumers on both imported and domestically made washing machines. One of the goals of using tariffs is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, making it easier for domestic producers to sell goods at a competitive price. A report Trump was required to send to Congress in 2018 about the washing machine tariffs said that the duties would “provide an impetus for importers to increase their prices.” In fact, the tariffs were put in place in response to Whirlpool’s complaint that washing machines made in South Korea and Mexico were being sold in the US for less than they cost to produce. When asked for proof that Trump’s proposed tariffs would not raise prices, his campaign pointed CNN to a study from Jeff Ferry, an economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America – a group that advocates for US producers and manufacturers. But Ferry’s study actually found that prices would rise by 3.26% over a six-year period following the implementation of the across-the-board tariffs, as a one-time price increase. His analysis looked at the impact the tariffs would have when combined with tax cuts paid for with the tariff revenue. In that scenario, Americans would see lower taxes and higher incomes despite the increase in prices, according to his study. Ferry told CNN that the traditional economic model used by most economists to analyze the price of tariffs downplays the positives that can happen – like an increase in domestic production and the creation of jobs – and that he adjusted his model accordingly. It’s true that after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made steel, some American steel companies reopened mills and created new jobs. But several studies – like one from the Tax Foundation and another from the US-China Business Council – say that overall, the US economy lost jobs due to Trump’s tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs other countries put on US goods and agricultural products.

Apple debuts iPhone 16 designed for AI | CNN Business,No Results Found,2024-09-09T15:55:57.482Z,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/apple-event-iphone-16-09-09-24/index.html,"Apple on Monday unveiled a host of new technology that features some impressive updates the company hopes will convince customers to upgrade. The company announced that the iPhone 16 would be the first model purpose-built for generative artificial intelligence, which will allow users to create text and images with a natural-language prompt.  Apple unveiled the latest version of its AirPods and the new new Apple Watch 10. Here are some of the highlights from the event: The newest iPhone 16 Pro Max will cost $1,199. That’s a hefty price tag on the surface, and would make it the most expensive iPhone Apple ever sold. But here’s the kicker: That’s before adjusting for inflation. The iPhone X in 2017 cost $999, and back then that was the most expensive iPhone the Cupertino, California-based company sold. But when adjusting for inflation, the $999 iPhone X actually costs $74 more than the price of the new iPhone 16 Pro Max, according to Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, when considering price changes to smartphones, the BLS doesn’t just look at how much cheaper or more expensive a phone got over time. Rather, the agency considers how much value upgrades, such as enhanced battery life, have added to the products relative to earlier versions. After taking that into account, smartphones currently cost consumers 8.2% less compared to a year ago, according to July CPI data. The new Apple iPhone 16 Pro will cost $999 and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will be $1,199, the company announced Monday. Both will be available for pre-order on Friday and in stores on September 20, it said. That’s the same dollar amount as last year’s model, the iPhone 15 Pro. Apple showed off the latest version of its high-end iPhone Pro, designed for Apple Intelligence at its core. The iPhone 16 Pro line is bigger by 0.2 inches than last year’s models: the entry-level Pro is 6.3 inches and the Pro Max is 6.9 inches, allowing users to see and do more on the display. Apple said the devices include the thinnest borders yet, feature the longest-lasting battery life on any of its iPhones, and comes in four colors: white titanium, darker titanium, natural titanium and a brown-colored desert titanium. Apple’s custom built A18 chip is also designed “hand in hand” to support Apple’s new AI tools. The device also lets you shoot in 4K resolution at 120 frames per second, with the ability to make the video slow-motion after recording a clip, rather than trying to grab the right setting as the action is happening. The Pro line is also getting an audio recording boost, including spatial audio with reduced background noise, enabling videos to pick conversations from the people centered in the video out from the ambient noise around them. The new iPhone 16 will start at $799, the company said on Monday after unveiling its new artificial intelligence features. The iPhone 16 Plus will start at $899. “Apple Intelligence” is artificial intelligence. But you didn’t hear the words “artificial” or “AI” coming out of the mouths of Apple’s leaders today. Instead of “AI-powered,” CEO Tim Cook and others are referring to Apple’s “intelligent” features. That’s because Apple is one of the most brand-conscious companies on the planet, and it knows something that often gets lost in the bot-pilled bubble of Silicon Valley: Regular people don’t like AI. Over the summer, a study published in the Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management found that describing a product as “AI-powered” tends to lower a customer’s intention to buy it. It’s not hard to see why: Our interactions with chatbots and AI image generators have quickly taught us to be skeptical of their stilted, often flatly incorrect renderings. When something looks inauthentic, we now say it looks like it was generated by a bot. When we hear a politician fumble their stump speech, we quip that it sounds like ChatGPT wrote it.  The always image-cautious Apple knows better than to fall into the “AI” trap, even if its whole pitch for the new iPhone is AI. Apple revealed more details about its artificial intelligence offering what the company is calling “Apple Intelligence,” which is used in its new iPhone 16 model. The features, which include writing tools that use AI to help draft emails and texts, will be included with the phone. Apple’s AI will also enable more natural conversations with Siri. “Apple intelligence marks the start of a new era for Siri and makes it more natural, more contextually relevant and more personal to you with richer language understanding,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s SVP of software engineering. Siri will now be able to pull from users’ text messages, meaning it can remind you of TV show and music recommendations sent by friends, said Federighi. “You’ll be able to simply say, ‘Send Erica the photos from Saturday’s barbecue,’ and Siri will dig up the photos and send them right off,” Federighi said. The company had already hinted at some of Apple’s new AI features in the past, including AI-generated custom emojis and more accessible photo-searching capabilities. The new iPhone 16 will allow users to get information about things around them just by pointing their camera, the company announced. The camera control feature, accessed with a button on the side of the phone, will give users access to “visual intelligence,” Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering, said on Monday. For example, after clicking the camera control, a user can point the camera at a restaurant and the iPhone 16 will pull up information like reviews, the menu and how to make a reservation. Federighi said this “visual intelligence” can also be used to identify things like dog breeds or landmarks and to add things to your calendar. Apple also touched on its previously announced partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to power some of these features. Federighi gave the example of using camera control to access ChatGPT to get help with homework. Some context: Apple previously announced that the iPhone 16 would be the first model purpose-built for generative artificial intelligence, which would allow users to create text and images with a natural language prompt. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone 16 “marks the beginning of an exciting new era,” thanks largely to Apple Intelligence. But there are some physical changes coming to the hardware, too. The new phones come in white, black, teal, aquamarine and pink. They’re also available in two sizes: 6.1 inches for the iPhone 16 and 6.7 inches for iPhone 16 Plus. The 16 line also comes packed with new buttons. First, there’a a customizable Action Button, replacing the mute button and allowing users to do anything from translating a phrase on the fly or programing a shortcut, such as turning on the flashlight or opening a calendar. Apple is also adding a physical button for easy access to opening the camera, initiated by sliding a finger. The iPhone 16 comes with 17% more system memory bandwidth to better support Apple Intelligence, a glass-ceramic screen that promises to be 50% tougher and 40% faster GPU than the previous model. Apple’s new AirPods Pro model will come with a clinical-grade over-the-counter hearing aid feature, the company said, as well as a clinical hearing test that users can access on their iPhones. “After you take a hearing test, your AirPods Pro are transformed into a personalized hearing aid, hosting the specific sounds you need in real time,” said Apple’s VP of Health, Sumbul Ahmad Desai. Desai said Apple expects to receive clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulators soon, but the feature will be available in over 100 countries and regions, including the US, this month. In addition to the hearing aid feature, the new AirPods Pro model will have other features that focus on hearing loss, including machine learning-powered hearing protection that reduces louder background noise. The new AirPods 4 will cost $129 and AirPods 4 with the active noise cancellation feature will be slightly more expensive at $179, the company announced on Monday. Both are available to pre-order now and will be available on September 20. Apple unveiled the latest version of its base AirPods line that the company calls its “most comfortable” set yet, along with a handful of features that are typically found on its higher-end Pro model AirPods, like active noise cancellation and “transparency mode,” which enables users to hear the outside ambient environment. Apple said the AirPods 4 were redesigned with advanced modeling tools to make the earbuds fit better into user ears. They also come with more control to play and pause music, start and end calls, and now include USB-C via the charging case. Other upgrades include longer lasting battery life (now up to 30 hours of battery life) and an upgraded chip for richer listening experience. Apple Watch Series 10 is also getting more advanced water tracking features. The latest device, which can now go 20 feet underwater, features a water temperature sensor and a depth gauge. It also has specs specifically designed for snorkeling, such as direction and time spent underwater. Other new features include a Tides app, which shows seven days of information for tides, coastline information, and sunrise and sunset times. For kayakers and rowers, a paddle logger app will monitor speed and give users haptic feedback to keep track of their route. Apple’s new Series 10 watch will start at $399, according to the company. It is now available to pre-order and will be available on September 20. The newest Apple Watch will come with some new features, the company said at its hardware event on Monday, including a bigger face and new apps. Here are some of the highlights: Apple’s latest watch can detect sleep apnea, the company said Monday. “Sleep apnea is a common condition in which your breathing stops and restarts many times while you sleep,” according to the National Institutes of Health, preventing people’s bodies from getting enough oxygen. “One of the biggest challenges is that 80% of people with sleep apnea are undiagnosed,” said Apple’s VP of Health Sumbul Ahmad Desai. “To detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor a new metric during sleep called breathing disturbances.” The feature is awaiting clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration, Desai said, and is expected to be available in over 150 countries and regions later this month. Sleep apnea affects approximately 39 million US adults, according to the National Council on Aging. Snoring is a common symptom. Previous iterations of the Apple Watch alerted users to Afib, a life-threatening irregular heartbeat. Apple began the event by introducing its Apple Watch Series 10. The new model is the thinnest and has the Apple Watch’s largest-ever screen display, Jeff Williams, Apple’s Chief Operating Officer, said. “With a larger screen, you can increase the font size without sacrificing content and you can see an additional line of text in apps like messages, mail and news,” Williams said. The device is more energy efficient than the previous one as well, and charges faster. The watch comes in a new polished titanium finish in jet black, along with rose gold and silver. The Apple event kicked off with a pre-recorded video of CEO Tim Cook teasing what’s to come today: Apple watch, Air Pods and the iPhone. He said the iPhone 16 will be the first mobile device built “from the ground up” to better support the company’s new AI software, Apple Intelligence. Notably, he called Apple Intelligence a “personal intelligence” system, appearing to avoid using the term “artificial intelligence.” Apple’s annual hardware event is now underway. The company is expected to reveal the first lineup of iPhones purpose-built for generative artificial intelligence. The company’s task during this event will be to show iPhone users what this kind of AI will look like in real life. It comes as Apple needs to convince investors that it hasn’t fallen behind in the AI arms race, as rivals have already released similar features with the new technology. Follow along for live updates or watch the live stream here. Here’s a closer look at some of the previously announced iOS 18 updates we may learn more about later today: Siri gets smarter. With Apple Intelligence, Siri will be able to answer questions using information from across multiple apps. For example, it could prep you for an upcoming meeting by telling you the time and location from your calendar, summarizing the prep document your colleague sent in an email and telling you the weather so you know how to dress. AI-generated emojis. Apple Intelligence will make it possible for users to create their own emojis with text prompt in iMessage, as well as to generate non-photorealistic images to send in conversations. OpenAI Partnership. In situations where OpenAI’s technology is better suited to answer a users’ question, Apple will let them opt-in to searching ChatGPT instead. The integration will work directly from their Apple device, even if a user doesn’t have a ChatGPT account. Hidden apps. New privacy updates for iPhone will let users “lock” certain apps so only they can open them using Face ID, Touch ID or their passcode. Users can also “hide” apps so they don’t show up on their home screen and no media from those apps appear elsewhere across their system. Real-time call transcripts. iPhone users will now be able to record and create transcripts of calls right from the phone app. All parties to the call will be notified when it is being recorded.  At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, the company announced some of the biggest things coming to its new AI platform, which it’s dubbed Apple Intelligence, this fall. This includes enabling more natural conversations with Siri, helping to draft emails, making it easier to find specific moments in your photo albums and incorporating users’ personal information into its responses. The company’s task today will be to show iPhone users what that will look like in real life. Under the hood, the iPhone 16 is also expected to get an upgraded processor to better handle a lot of these features without compromising battery life. It’s also possible there could be some subtle changes to the appearance of the iPhone, such as a wider screen or updated edges, to further emphasize this a big year to upgrade. Apple faces immense pressure ahead of the event to prove the new AI features and other iPhone 16 updates are worth shelling out for an upgrade. The company also needs to convince investors that it hasn’t fallen behind in the AI arms race, as rivals have already released similar features with the new technology. Since the launch of the iPhone 12 with 5G connectivity in 2020, the company has given users few exciting reasons to buy the latest generation. Phone cameras have largely advanced to the point where they’re sufficient for most people’s day-to-day needs without major hardware changes, and at some point the human eye isn’t even capable of perceiving higher screen resolutions. As a result, iPhone sales, which make up half of the company’s revenue, have been sluggish. If Apple delivers, it could cash in. About 300 million iPhones worldwide have not been upgraded in more than four years, according to a research note from analyst Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush last month. Apple is set to unveil its first lineup of iPhones built for generative artificial intelligence, the kind that lets people create images and helps them write emails, during its annual hardware event on Monday. The event starts at 1 p.m. ET and you can watch the livestream here. The event was teased with the cryptic motto of “it’s glow time,” and Apple is staying mum thus far on what it means. Apple is expected to reveal its new iPhone 16 on Monday, which will be the main focus of its annual hardware event. But there will likely also be some changes coming to other Apple devices. The Apple Watch Series 10 is expected to be thinner than its predecessors but with a larger screen, and the company is also set to roll out new low-end and mid-tier AirPod offerings, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, citing unnamed people familiar with the situation. Those updates would follow new software offerings for both devices that Apple announced at its annual developers conference in June. AirPods users will be able to answer or decline a call with just a nod or shake of their head. And new vital sign tracking on Apple Watch can notify users when they may be getting sick, based on signals like body temperature and heart rate. A major question heading into Apple’s annual hardware event on Monday is how much customers will have to shell out for the new iPhone 16 lineup. For the last four years, the starting price at launch for the new iPhones was $799. Apple enthusiasts have debated for years whether iPhone models should be cheaper, while investors would prefer maximum profit. Many analysts, including CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino, say Apple could modestly raise prices “across the board” for the iPhone lineup because of the new AI features and the cost to the company of delivering them. However, it almost certainly won’t be a major hike because “they don’t want to lose the (customer) enthusiasm because of sticker shock,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told CNN. If Apple delivers, it could cash in — roughly 300 million iPhones worldwide have not been upgraded in more than four years, according to a research note from analyst Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush last month. Apple is expected to unveil its new lineup of iPhones that are built for artificial intelligence today, but that also brings up questions about privacy and data for some users. Apple Intelligence — the collective brandname for all of Apple’s own AI tools — is intended to be more of a personal assistant than anything else. It takes in specific information about your relationships and contacts, messages and emails you’ve sent, events you’ve been to, meetings on your calendar and other highly individualized bits of data about your life. But while Apple Intelligence will have access to a wide range of your personal data, it will lack what companyexecutives called “world knowledge” — more general information about history, current events and other things that are less directly linked to you. That’s where ChatGPT comes in. Users will be able to have Siri forward questions and prompts to ChatGPT — on an opt-in basis — or have ChatGPT help you write documents within Apple apps. What about your data: Since Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT will be used for largely different purposes, the amount and type of information users send to each AI may be different, too. ChatGPT won’t necessarily or automatically have access to your highly personal details, although you might choose to share some of this data and more with OpenAI if you decide to use ChatGPT through Apple. During a demo in June, Apple showed Siri asking the user for permission to send a prompt to ChatGPT before doing so. While Apple users will have to send their personal information and AI queries to OpenAI if they want to use ChatGPT, Apple has said that most of the time Apple Intelligence won’t be sending user data anywhere. As much as possible, Apple will try to process AI prompts directly on your device using smaller AI models. This is similar to how Apple already processes FaceID and other sensitive data — the idea being that processing data right on the device limits risky exposure. Your data can’t be intercepted or hacked from a central server if it never actually goes anywhere. Apple is the most valuable public company in the United States and now it’s taking another step in working to convince investors that it hasn’t fallen behind in the AI arms race. The company is expected to unveil the iPhone 16 today, which and it’s likely to be the first version to be able to accommodate Apple’s version of AI – dubbed “Apple Intelligence” by the company – natively. In June, Apple first announced the generative AI features for iPhones at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference — sending stocks climbing and passing Microsoft to become the most valuable public company. At that conference, Apple announced a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to power some of its phone’s features. Although the partnership will likely give the company a much-needed boost, Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that has yet to win public trust has raised criticism, especially for taking user inputs and incorporating them into ChatGPT’s data set. Those may cause some privacy challenges down the road for a company that has long prioritized its users’ safety and anonymity. And today, the company will aim to show users and investors what that looks like in real life."
Retired military leaders defend Harris while placing blame on Trump for Afghanistan withdrawal in letter | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:49 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T15:22:09.094Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/kamala-harris-afghanistan-withdrawal/index.html,"Several retired military officials issued a letter in support of Vice President Kamala Harris as Republicans attempt to tie her to the chaotic 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. “Vice President Kamala Harris is the best – and only – presidential candidate in this race who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief. She has demonstrated her ability to take on the most difficult national security challenges in the Situation Room and on the international stage,” the group wrote in a National Security Leaders for America letter. The letter cited Harris “rallying our allies against Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine to standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Indo-Pacific against China’s provocative actions, to advancing U.S. leadership on space and artificial intelligence.” The letter comes after House Republicans and Democrats issued dueling documents casting blame for mistakes made in the US exit from Afghanistan. The Republican report cites Harris as having worked “in lockstep with President Biden behind the scenes to withdraw all US troops.” It also aims to implicate Harris in its accusations by referring to the current government as “the Biden-Harris administration.” The group of retired generals placed blame on former President Donald Trump for “putting service members in harm’s way” while he was in office, and argued he didn’t leave the Biden administration in a position to execute a withdrawal efficiently. “Without involving the Afghan government, he and his Administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield,” the letter claimed. “Then, he left President Biden and Vice President Harris with no plans to execute a withdrawal, and with little time to do so. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris Administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.” The exit of American troops from Afghanistan had always been a critical goal for Biden. During his time as vice president, Biden repeatedly pushed then-President Barack Obama to draw down troop numbers – advice which Obama ignored, ordering a troop surge before beginning a drawdown. Trump also worked toward a withdrawal during his time as president. His administration entered into an agreement with the Taliban for a May 1, 2021, deadline for troops to exit the country; Biden as president said that timeline wasn’t feasible, and pushed it back several months to the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Biden hoped to avoid any optics during the drawdown that would draw comparisons to the chaotic withdraw of US military troops from Vietnam in 1975, which was immortalized by pictures of Americans hurriedly rushing to a helicopter from the roof of the US embassy during the fall of Saigon. Discussing his plan in July 2021, Biden vowed there would be “no circumstance in which you are going to see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.” The reality, though, was more complicated. The bloody and chaotic withdrawal included a suicide bombing that killed 13 American troops and about 170 Afghans outside Kabul’s airport. Inside, some Afghans fell to their deaths after clinging to the underside of American military planes in a last-ditch and futile effort to escape Taliban rule – exactly the type of imagery Biden had hoped to avoid, and which presented the first major foreign policy issue for Biden’s presidency. It would later be overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the Hamas attack against Israel last October. Since then, Democrats and Republicans have traded blame for the chaotic withdrawal. Republicans accused Biden of demanding a withdrawal no matter the costs while Democrats blamed Trump for striking the Taliban deal that set the withdrawal in motion in the first place. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as Trump’s national security adviser, has argued Trump deserves some of the blame for the chaos. Even three years later, the politics of the withdrawal continue to trail the campaign. During a visit to Arlington National Cemetery last month to commemorate the Kabul airport bombing, staffers for Trump’s campaign reportedly brushed aside a cemetery worker who tried preventing the campaign from taking photos or video in the section of the cemetery containing the remains of troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump’s campaign insisted there were no violations of the law and attacked the worker involved in the confrontation. Harris responded to the controversy by saying Trump “is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.” This story has been updated with additional report."
Trump says he will vote to legalize adult recreational marijuana use in Florida | CNN Politics,"Published 10:19 AM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T14:19:47.593Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/trump-marijuana-florida/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump said Sunday he will vote for a ballot measure in Florida that would legalize adult recreational marijuana use – a position that puts him at odds with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republican leaders in the state. “As I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use. We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product. As a Floridian, I will be voting YES on Amendment 3 this November,” Trump posted on Truth Social. Trump continued, “As President, we will continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking for state authorized companies, and supporting states rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.” The decision is in line with the criminal justice reform he signed into law as president, though Trump has also made being seen as tough on crime central to his political identity. Trump is taking a position largely popular with Americans, even as members of his own party have opposed it. It’s a rare area of agreement between Trump and his opponent in November. Vice President Kamala Harris has supported efforts by the Biden administration to pardon people convicted of having small amounts of marijuana and the effort to reclassify the drug in federal law to a lower level. Harris has her own political liabilities around crime, having been criticized for prosecuting people for possessing small amounts of drugs during her time as a prosecutor. Trump previously said in a post that he thought the ballot initiative in Florida would pass “whether people like it or not,” and that he thought adults in Florida shouldn’t be arrested for having “personal amounts” of marijuana. He also called for the Florida legislature to create laws that prohibit recreational marijuana use in public spaces. Trump’s pledge to “unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug” comes after he praised medical marijuana on the Lex Fridman Podcast last week. The ballot initiative, which would require 60% of the vote to pass, “Allows adults 21 years or older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products and marijuana accessories for non-medical personal consumption by smoking, ingestion, or otherwise,” according to the text of the measure. It also “allows Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers, and other state licensed entities, to acquire, cultivate, process, manufacture, sell, and distribute such products and accessories.” DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the GOP presidential primary but then endorsed the former president when he suspended his campaign, has bashed the ballot initiative as “radical” and said earlier this year if it passed, “This state will start to smell like marijuana in our cities and towns.” The Florida GOP declared its opposition to the ballot initiative in May, and the Republican Party of Florida’s executive board unanimously passed a resolution opposing it. Florida GOP Chairman Evan Power released a statement saying this amendment, as well as a separate abortion amendment, “are unnecessary attempts by an increasingly shrinking minority who know the only way to win support for their radical agenda is to confuse and mislead the electorate.”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN’s Manu Raju “we need a new chapter,” on Israel policy under Vice President Kamala Harris, when asked if she should break from Joe Biden on the issue. Some background: In March, the New York Democrat accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinian people and advocated for cuts to US military aid until humanitarian relief flows freely in Gaza. Her decision to use the term genocide, as she did during a floor speech in the House chamber, was “taken with extraordinary gravity,” she told CNN. Jessica Leeds, who previously accused Donald Trump of sexual assault and was a trial witness in a high-profile case against the former president, said Monday that she “laughed out loud” when she heard he recently disputed her allegation and said she “would not have been the chosen one.” Leeds was one of the first women to come forward during the 2016 presidential campaign to allege that Trump sexually assaulted her. She said she was seated in first class on an airplane next to Trump in the 1970s when he suddenly began groping her. Leeds said she fought off Trump and moved to the back of the airplane. “I was not the first, of course I was not the last. But there have been enough so that he doesn’t remember,” Leeds told Cooper. Asked about Leeds’ comments, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung again denied Trump had ever met Leeds and said that “whatever fable she’s trying to peddle is only meant to interfere in the election and distract from” Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival. Read more about Leeds’ interview here Several prominent Republicans, including the party’s vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, promoted false claims on Monday that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. It’s the latest turn in a campaign that has increasingly embraced race-baiting messaging, questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity while seeking to undermine her immigration policies. The rumors center on the Ohio city of Springfield, which has experienced a surge in recent migration from Haitians seeking to escape a Caribbean country that has been rocked from years of natural disasters, political assassinations and gang rule. A post in a Springfield Facebook group recently claimed a neighbor’s daughter’s friend found their missing cat hanging from a branch at a Haitian neighbor’s home, and it was being prepped to be eaten, according to the Springfield News-Sun. Those rumors were picked up by conservative media and then spread on X, where they gained widespread traction on Monday. Vance posted a video of himself discussing migration to Ohio at a recent hearing. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country. Where is our border czar?” Some accounts shared AI-generated pictures of Trump holding a cat in his hands while being chased by crowds of Black men. The unsubstantiated claims appear to be the result of an unwieldy game of telephone that began as a rumor in a local Facebook group before spiraling to reach the highest echelons of conservative media and the Republican Party. Read more here about the false rumor about Haitian immigrants Vice President Kamala Harris has so far largely avoided confronting Donald Trump on some of his most racially inflammatory policy proposals — even as she continues to underperform among the Hispanic and Black voters who could face the harshest consequences from the former president’s plans. Not calling out his ideas for the mass deportation of undocumented migrants, for example, or the pressure he wants to put on local governments to adopt tougher policing tactics is a cautious strategy that may reflect the unease in some Democratic circles about bringing attention to the volatile issues of immigration and crime. But it could also deny her some of her best potential tools to pry back some of the Black and Hispanic voters among whom most polls show Trump is still running better than in 2020. Since Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Trump has constantly attempted to portray her as weak on immigration and crime. The former California attorney general has sought to rebut those charges by emphasizing her toughness on those questions — especially her prosecutorial background in a border state — and highlighting Trump’s torpedoing of a bipartisan border deal.  But the real question for many of the groups working on these issues is whether she tries to turn the tables by portraying Trump’s solutions to these problems as extreme, impractical and racially divisive. Gary Segura, a pollster who works with UnidosUS, a leading Hispanic advocacy group that has endorsed Harris, said that the vice president was missing an opportunity by avoiding a confrontation with Trump over his mass deportation plans, for example. Read more of the analysis here The stage is set for the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. ABC, which is hosting the event, shared a photo of the stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. For Harris, it will be a marquee moment to show Americans that she is ready to assume the presidency. Trump, meanwhile, is eager to negatively shape voters’ perceptions of his Democratic rival and halt the gains she has made since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket in July. The Trump campaign may be “goin’ to Wichita” before the November election, but The White Stripes would prefer former President Donald Trump stop traveling with their music as part of his playlist.  Jack and Meg White, formerly of the rock duo The White Stripes, filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York on Monday, accusing Trump and his campaign of “flagrant misappropriation” and copyright infringement of their 2003 song “Seven Nation Army.”  Their complaint, obtained by CNN, states the two musicians “vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by Defendant Trump when he was President and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks,” noting that the song was used without their “knowledge or consent.”  CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign and representatives for Jack White for comment. Last month, White said he would seek legal action after Margo Martin, a deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, shared on social media a since-deleted video of Trump boarding a plane with “Seven Nation Army” playing. In the Whites’ lawsuit, their attorneys write that the defendants “chose to ignore and not respond to Plaintiffs’ pre-litigation efforts to resolve the matters at issue in this action, leaving Plaintiffs with no choice but to seek judicial recourse in order to hold Defendants accountable.” Jack and Meg White are among several artists, including Celine Dion, Foo Fighters and ABBA, who have objected to Trump using their music for his campaign. They are the only living artists to file a lawsuit against Trump in 2024. The estate of soul singer Isaac Hayes also sued the Trump campaign for copyright infringement. Senior Senate Republicans on Monday downplayed former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney’s endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, saying they doubt it would affect the outcome of the election.   Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley argued that Cheney was “just one person” and that the “millions and millions of votes that (former President Donald) Trump got in the primary to be our nominee” is more important “than just one vote.” Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican who represents Cheney’s home state of Wyoming, blasted Cheney’s move, saying, “He’s clearly not thinking about Wyoming anymore. It’s no longer part of his life. President Trump is really, really good for Wyoming and he’s just out of touch with people of his home state.” Asked if Cheney is influential with some GOP voters, Barrasso said he’s not in Wyoming and then took a swipe at Cheney’s daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a fierce Trump opponent.   “I don’t think it’s any surprise given what his daughter had done over the last two years,” Barrasso said.   North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis also pointed to the influence of Liz Cheney on her father.   “I was a bit surprised by that, but you also sort of have a daughter involved,” he said. “I don’t know what exactly led him to do that. But I look at the world today, I look at Ukraine, I look at Israel from a national security perspective it’s hard for me to understand why somebody with the depth of experience in national security went that way. But people get to endorse who they want to endorse.” Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance continue to falsely describe how one of their major policy proposals, across-the-board tariffs, would work. Trump has falsely, and repeatedly, claimed that China – not US importers – pays the tariff. At a rally in Arizona in mid-August, he claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, is lying when she refers to his tariff plan as a “Trump tax.” “She is a liar. She makes up crap … I am going to put tariffs on other countries coming into our country, and that has nothing to do with taxes to us. That is a tax on another country,” Trump said. In September, he repeated the claim during an interview with Fox News that it’s “a tax on another country.” Vance said in late August that as a result of tariffs Trump imposed during his presidency, “prices went down for American citizens.” But that’s not true. Facts First: Trump and Vance’s claims about how tariffs work are false. A tariff is a tax that is paid by US businesses – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. One of the intended goals of a tariff is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, and study after study show that the duties do drive up costs for Americans. Here’s how tariffs work: When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American buyer. “It’s fair to call a tariff a tax because that’s exactly what it is,” said Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. “There’s no way around it. It is a tax on people who buy things from foreign businesses.” Trump has said that if elected, he would impose tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. He also said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar. These duties would add to the tariffs he put on foreign steel and aluminum, washing machines, and many Chinese-made goods including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. President Joe Biden has left many of the Trump-era tariffs in place. A foreign company may choose to pay the tariff or to lower its prices to stay competitive with US-made goods that aren’t impacted by the duty. But study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. Read the full fact check CNN chief national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny looks back at moments from Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s past debates to see what to expect in their encounter on Tuesday. Ahead of a key US presidential debate, families of several American hostages held in Gaza are calling on US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to offer new ideas for securing the immediate release of their loved ones. CNN spoke with relatives of three US citizens held in Gaza who all expressed frustration that attempts to free their family members over the past 11 months had so far failed. “Perhaps the deal proposed by President (Joe) Biden back in December was good then, but maybe we need something different now,” said Adi Alexander, whose 20-year-old son Edan was serving in the Israeli military when he was abducted by Hamas on October 7. The family members told CNN that the approach should include the US seeking new pressure points on Hamas and its sponsor Iran, as well as on other nations with potential influence, like Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, the Gulf state which hosts Hamas officials and has helped facilitate negotiations. Incentives, such as trade deals, sanctions relief and international prisoner swaps should also be evaluated, the hostage families told CNN, similar to recent deals agreed between Washington and Moscow to free US citizens such as Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and US basketball star Brittney Griner. Read more about what families are saying Both Democratic and Republican politicians are hoping tomorrow’s debate between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is an opportunity for voters to see the difference between the candidates. He said Harris is an “unselfish person” who cares about “people and families,” and attacked Trump’s agenda as “selfish” and “centered on Project 2025,” a right wing policy blueprint that Trump has tried to distance himself from, though several people linked to him authored it. Republican Whip John Thune said he is hoping Trump can draw a stark contrast with Harris and “expose her record” on the debate stage.  Thune said Trump needs to “stay focused on the issues. And don’t make things personal. This is a choice for the American voters. It ought to be about people’s records, their positions and their vision for the future.” The world knows what kind of a debater former President Donald Trump is: loose with the facts, quick with an insult and cocksure to the extreme. But what about Vice President Kamala Harris? While her 2020 presidential campaign barely registered – she ended her campaign in December 2019, before the first primary votes were cast – Harris did leave a mark in one important way. On the primary debate stage in June 2019, before she was his running mate or he was anywhere near the White House, Harris eviscerated Joe Biden, attacking him on his past praise of men like the late Sens. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and John Stennis of Mississippi, “who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.” Harris has, no doubt, spent her debate prep time working on material to use against her rival this year. She and Trump are set to meet for the first time and debate Tuesday night in the key state of Pennsylvania. ABC News is broadcasting the event. Unlike with Biden, Harris won’t have to go back to the 1970s to come up with lines of attack. She can look to his criminal conviction in New York, his liability in a sex abuse and defamation case, his nationalist policies, his unfounded claims about election fraud – for which there is no evidence – or his outrageous pledge to jail election officials. But, also during that 2019 debate, Harris was criticized by former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard about her record as a prosecutor. Gabbard argued that Harris was too hard on marijuana offenders and had other criticisms of her time as a prosecutor. Gabbard has reportedly helped Trump with his own debate prep, and Trump will want to paint Harris as to the left of the American mainstream – someone who changed her positions for political expediency in 2019 and has now changed them again to run for president. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be on the ballot in Michigan, the state’s highest court ruled on Monday, despite Kennedy pushing to have his name removed after the former presidential candidate ended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump. The court said its majority opinion that Kennedy “has not shown an entitlement to this extraordinary relief” after seeking to have his name removed from the ballot, reversing a Michigan Court of Appeals decision to take him off the ballot on Friday after an appeal from the Michigan secretary of state. Kennedy had qualified for Michigan’s ballot after being nominated by the Natural Law Party, a minor party with ballot access in the state. In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Welch cited Natural Law Party chair Doug Dern’s opposition to Kennedy’s withdrawal four months after his party nominated Kennedy as part of her basis for concluding Kennedy did not have a “clear right” to be removed from the state’s ballot. Some background: The decision undercuts Kennedy’s hope to push his supporters toward Trump after he endorsed the former president last month. Kennedy has been attempting to remove his name from battleground states as part of a strategy to maximize Trump’s support in places that could determine the outcome of the election. Last week he told his supporters to back Trump “no matter what state you live in.” The ruling settles a hard-fought legal effort by Kennedy to remove his name from Michigan’s ballot, after initially losing a Michigan Court of Claims decision. He then appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which ruled in his favor to remove him from the ballot on Friday before that decision was overturned on Monday. Absentee voting in Michigan is scheduled to start September 26, although ballots for overseas and military voters are required to go out by September 21. Ethan Cohen contributed to this report United We Dream Action, the political arm of the largest immigrant youth-led organization, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, marking the first presidential endorsement in a general election.  Sollod underscored the stakes of the election for immigrants, telling CNN that the importance of it contributed to the group’s decision to weigh in at this point of the race. UWDA has previously endorsed candidates in the primaries. Since Harris assumed the top of the ticket, allies and immigrant advocates have pushed her team to address not only border security but also the millions of undocumented immigrants in the US. Harris allies have often pointed to her longstanding relationship with the immigrant community dating back to her days holding office in California when describing her approach to immigration.  The Harris campaign quickly went on the offensive on immigration in late July, citing her work prosecuting transnational gang members and the failed bipartisan border measure.   “We want her to be a pro-immigrant president,” Sollod said. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff on Tuesday weighed in on Vice President Kamala Harris’ preparation ahead of the presidential debate, telling a crowd in North Carolina that “she’s ready.” “There’s a debate tomorrow, and the one thing she did say to the press yesterday was simply, ‘I’m ready,’” Emhoff said during a campaign stop in Raleigh. He was referencing remarks Harris made during their walk in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, yesterday in which she gave a thumbs up and said “I’m ready” after being asked by pool reporters if she is ready to debate Trump. Emhoff gave a preview of the past few weeks on the trail, emphasizing the robust campaign schedule has resulted in him barely seeing the vice president.  Emhoff’s remarks came during a stop on the campaign’s “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” bus tour where he was joined by Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz. The two outlined the stakes of the election for reproductive freedom while laying out the Harris-Walz ticket’s vision to move the country forward. The Trump campaign on Monday previewed some of the lines of attack that former President Donald Trump is likely to deploy during ABC’s presidential debate tomorrow. The campaign argued that Vice President Kamala Harris “owns everything from this administration.” In a call with reporters ahead of Tuesday’s debate, Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller pointed to the handling of the US-Mexico border and illegal immigration, Harris casting tie-breaking votes in the Senate to pass stimulus bills and the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as issues that the campaign believes Harris “owns.”  Miller also said he expects “there’ll be some surprises during the debate tomorrow.” Miller pointed to Harris’ interview with CNN in which she said her “values have not changed,” even as her positions on some issues have changed, and argued that answer, “really opens the door to talking about what are those values, what has Kamala Harris stood for over the years going all the way back to the beginning.” Miller claimed Harris has been the one in charge of the country, not President Joe Biden, and at one point referred to the Biden administration as the “Harris-Biden” administration, though Harris is not the president.  On Trump, Miller said that the former president is “going to be himself. I think that’s an important thing to keep in mind here.” Adding that Harris is “in this debate bootcamp being drilled by new advisers who worked for President Obama that she doesn’t know.” Miller said, “All these new people, these strangers trying to put thoughts in her head. These binders of stats and details. She has no idea what any of this is. No idea whatsoever. And she’s trying to figure out what type of person she wants to be, because her positions are changing, though her values have stayed the same.”  Asked how Trump has been preparing, Miller said Trump has been giving both longer interviews and shorter pull-aside interviews, news conferences, rally speeches and town halls.  “Every possible style of question President Trump is prepared for because that’s what he’s been doing this entire campaign,” he said. A new CNN Poll of Polls, including national polls conducted since the Democratic National Convention, finds a tight race with no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris has an average of 49% support in the new CNN Poll of Polls while Trump has 48% across five polls conducted between August 23 and Sept. 6. That’s effectively unchanged from the previous Poll of Polls average. The latest average includes a Pew Research Center poll released Monday, which finds Harris and Trump tied at 49% among registered voters and shows little change in voter preference from their previous survey conducted in early August. More on the poll: The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of the five most recent non-partisan, national surveys of registered or likely voters that meet CNN’s standards and ask about a 2024 presidential general election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Surveys including named third-party or independent candidates are not included. White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby blamed the Trump administration for the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, which was outlined in a report from House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul on Monday. The report released Monday has been lambasted by Democrats for being politically motivated while revealing no new information. Republicans have said the withdrawal, which saw the deaths of 13 service members after an explosion near the Kabul airport, was a failure of the Biden administration. Kirby declined to further “belabor” the White House’s feelings about the partisan nature of the report. Retired military leaders place blame on Trump administration as well: Several retired military officials issued a letter in support of Vice President Kamala Harris as Republicans attempt to tie her to the chaotic 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The letter comes after House Republicans and Democrats issued dueling documents casting blame for mistakes made in the US exit from Afghanistan. The Republican report cites Harris as having worked “in lockstep with President Biden behind the scenes to withdraw all US troops.” It also aims to implicate Harris in its accusations by referring to the current government as “the Biden-Harris administration.” The group of retired generals placed blame on former President Donald Trump for “putting service members in harm’s way” while he was in office, and argued he didn’t leave the Biden administration in a position to execute a withdrawal efficiently. With less than two months to Election Day, three Republicans on Georgia’s five-member board are pushing through new rules that could jeopardize election certification, particularly if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the state, election experts and voting rights groups say. The reshaping of the election board in one of the most critical battleground states of 2024 highlights how some Republicans who cast doubt on the 2020 presidential election results have now taken on prominent roles driving election rules and, in some areas, overseeing elections. The board is set to consider another slate of new rules at its September 20 meeting. Read more about how the changes could impact the 2024 election. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance posted an eight-part thread on social media picking apart Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign policy page, which was posted to her website Sunday night, specifically her plan on taxes, home ownership, rental prices, small businesses, education, energy, child care and the southern border. “It has been 50 days since Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party. In the dead of the night yesterday, she finally released her campaign policy page. Here’s what I think of it,” Vance posted on X. The Ohio senator claimed that the housing crisis in American can’t be fixed until the border is secure. Specifically on her affordable child care proposals, Vance criticized her “one-size-fits-all model” and said it excludes families who prefer faith-based providers or those who prefer to stay home to watch their children or use the help of a loved one. At the New York Economic Club, Trump dodged a question on whether he would commit to prioritizing legislation that would make child care affordable, saying childcare “is relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in.” Highlighting how he is a “working-class kid who went to Ohio State on the GI Bill and then to Yale,” Vance also claimed Harris “wants to double down on the failures of our education system.” More context: The Harris/Walz campaign website added a host of policy positions under an issues tab on Sunday. Republicans have persistently called out the Democratic ticket for failing to clearly outline their policy aspirations.  Harris’ vision for what she characterizes as “a new way forward” includes details on how to address economic anxieties, safeguard fundamental freedoms, promote public safety, and strengthen national security. CNN has reached out to the campaign for comment.  CNN’s Eva McKend contributed reporting to this post. Part of Kamala Harris’ campaign strategy going into Tuesday is to use the presidential debate as an opportunity to introduce the vice president to undecided voters, alongside trying to expose former President Donald Trump and “his true colors,” as one source described it to CNN. While the campaign has boasted of the recent momentum behind the vice president, Harris aides and allies see Tuesday night’s debate as an opening to try to broaden the base.  Sources close to the campaign describe the vice president as keenly aware of the strategies Trump is likely to employ, but her team is also preparing her to remain focused on the policy issues and her vision to reach those persuadable voters.  “She’s very aware of who he is and what he’s going to bring,” one of the sources said. “She has a plan. She has a vision. She’s going to put it forward.” It’s not wholly unlike the strategy Harris had previously been planning for—reminding voters of the unpredictability of Trump and, as she’s repeatedly mentioned on the trail, what her campaign has cast as attacks to personal freedoms. Before Harris became the lead of the party’s ticket, her team had been preparing her to take that message against Trump’s vice presidential nominee, JD Vance. That has spilled into her preparations heading into Tuesday.  “She’s been prepping for this for a long time,” one source told CNN. “Vance was a stand-in for Trump. We were always taking it to Trump.” Kamala Harris launched a new ad Monday aimed at touting economic proposals and drawing a contrast with Donald Trump, declaring that “this election is about two very different visions for our nation.” Airing ahead of tomorrow night’s high-profile debate showdown, Harris’ new ad emphasizes her policies to lower the cost of living, as inflation during the Biden-Harris administration has created a political vulnerability for Democrats that Republicans have seized on in their attacks. She continues, “Together we will build an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed. Now is the time to chart a new way forward.” The new ad first began airing in Nevada this morning, and the campaign also launched a version of the ad with on-screen text in Spanish. Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance continue to falsely describe how one of their major policy proposals — across-the-board tariffs — would work. Trump has falsely, and repeatedly, claimed that China — not US importers — pay the tariff. At a rally in Arizona in mid-August, he claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, is lying when she refers to his tariff plan as a “Trump tax.” “She is a liar. She makes up crap … I am going to put tariffs on other countries coming into our country, and that has nothing to do with taxes to us. That is a tax on another country,” Trump said. In September, he repeated the claim during an interview with Fox News: “It’s not a tax on the middle class. It’s a tax on another country.” And he said again during a rally in Wisconsin Saturday that “it’s not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country.” Vance said in late August that as a result of tariffs Trump imposed during his presidency, “prices went down for American citizens.” “They went up for the Chinese but they went down for our people,” Vance added. But that’s not true. Facts First: Trump and Vance’s claims about how tariffs work are false. A tariff is a tax that is paid by US businesses — not other countries — when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. One of the intended goals of a tariff is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, and study after study shows that the duties do drive up costs for Americans. Read more about how tariff’s actually work. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be in Philadelphia for the presidential debate on Tuesday as a surrogate for former President Donald Trump, a spokesperson for Kennedy tells CNN. Kennedy will appear in the spin room — where supporters of each candidate put their “spin” on the debate in conversations with media — on behalf of Trump, according to the spokesperson. Kennedy endorsed Trump and suspended his independent White House bid last month, urging his supporters to back the former president. Trump has said Kennedy would play a role in his administration if he is elected. Kennedy’s alliance with Trump came after a long history of attacking the former president. Trump’s running mate: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance will also hit the spin room Tuesday, after attending a Philadelphia debate watch party hosted by the Trump campaign, according to a source familiar with the plans. Earlier on Tuesday, Vance has a fundraiser in Greenville, North Carolina.  CNN’s Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post. An important part of Vice President Kamala Harris’ preparations to debate Donald Trump Tuesday night has entailed getting ready for possible insults, derogatory comments and name-calling from the former president, two sources familiar said.   The team helping to prepare Harris have had to look no further than Trump’s recent public comments, including at his political rallies, to get a sense of the kinds of things the GOP nominee may say on the debate stage.  It is anybody’s guess just how much Trump will be inclined to try to personally insult his rival tomorrow night — and how much of it will even be heard by the public, given that candidates’ mics will be off when it is not their turn to speak. If the mics were on the entire time, the Harris adviser said, “it would show he does not have the temperament to be president.”  As she has been reading up on Trump’s policy positions, past comments and even insults he has directed at her, two people Harris has extensively spoken with are President Joe Biden and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton — both have experienced insults thrown their way by the former GOP president on the debate stage.  Coming just weeks after the Democratic National Convention, where Harris formally accepted her party’s nomination for the presidency, the vice president’s advisers see this week’s ABC News debate as a critical opportunity to speak to voters, including those who are starting to tune in for the first time and are interested in giving her a second look.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, two prominent surrogates for former President Donald Trump, will speak at a rally alongside anti-vaccine activists and Trump supporters on the National Mall in Washington, DC later this month.  The rally, organized by the group “Rescue The Republic,” a group founded by anti-vaccine organizers Matt Tune and Bret Weinstein and Libertarian National Committee chair Angela McArdle, will feature Kennedy and Gabbard speaking alongside prominent anti-vaccine voices, including actor Russell Brand, and conservative firebrands like Lara Logan.  The group says the rally is designed to have the “left and right unite.” Trump and his allies have touted the endorsements of Kennedy and Gabbard, two former Democrats, to signal his appeal across party lines.  There is a new addition to the Harris/Walz campaign website: a host of policy positions under an issues tab.  Republicans have persistently called out the Democratic ticket for failing to outline their policy aspirations online clearly.  Now, with just two days to go until her debate with former President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris’ vision for what she characterizes as “a new way forward” includes details on how to address economic anxieties, safeguard fundamental freedoms, promote public safety, and strengthen national security. CNN has reached out to the campaign for comment.  ABC News officially announced the rules last week of tomorrow’s presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden. Harris’ camp had lobbied for the mics to remain on for the duration of the debate to “fully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates,” to no avail. Here are the rules of the face off: The network, according to the source familiar, offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said. You will be able to watch the ABC debate live on CNN tomorrow night at 9 p.m. ET. CNN’s Hadas Gold and Kate Sullivan contributed reporting to this post. Several retired military officials issued a letter in support of Vice President Kamala Harris as Republicans attempt to tie her to the chaotic 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The group explained in their letter that Harris “has demonstrated her ability to take on the most difficult national security challenges in the Situation Room and on the international stage, from rallying our allies against Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine to standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Indo-Pacific against China’s provocative actions, to advancing U.S. leadership on space and artificial intelligence.” The letter comes as House Republicans and Democrats issued dueling documents casting blame for mistakes made in the US exit from Afghanistan. The Republican report cites Harris as having worked “in lockstep with President Biden behind the scenes to withdraw all US troops.” It also aims to implicate Harris in its accusations by referring to the current government as “the Biden-Harris administration.” Generals slam Trump: The group of retired generals placed blame on former President Donald Trump for “putting service members in harm’s way” while he was in office, and argued he didn’t leave the Biden administration in a position to execute a withdrawal efficiently.  “Without involving the Afghan government, he and his Administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield,” the letter claimed. The group also accused Trump of leaving President Joe Biden and Harris “with no plans to execute a withdrawal, and with little time to do so. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris Administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.” The fight to define Kamala Harris is dominating campaign advertising as the vice president heads into her first debate matchup with Donald Trump tomorrow night, and as polling shows there are many voters still seeking more information about the new Democratic standard bearer. According to AdImpact data, 60 out of 80 unique TV ads that aired in the presidential race over the last 30 days targeted Harris, including ads with either a positive or negative tone, and ads drawing contrasts. Over the same period, 42 out of 80 TV ads targeted Trump. Ads targeting Harris accounted for about $194 million out of $215 million in total broadcast TV spending over the last 30 days, reflecting both sides’ focus on shaping perceptions of the vice president. By comparison, ads targeting Trump over the same period account for about $69 million in TV spending. More on ad spending: Looking ahead, Democrats continue to hold a significant advantage in future ad bookings through Election Day — though Republicans have cut into that edge as leading GOP outside groups have bought more ad time. With a total of about $534 million in advertising bookings left to air in the presidential race, Democrats lead with about $333.3 million to about $200.7 million for Republicans. Vice President Kamala Harris said that she predicts former president Donald Trump will lie during Tuesday’s debate and expects him to attack her racial and gender identity. Harris said in an interview on “The Rickey Smiley Morning Show” released Monday that she is preparing for Trump to “speak a lot of untruths” and to attack her personally during Tuesday’s debate, pointing to the “tired playbook” of attacks he’s thrown at her and others throughout his political career. Harris specifically referenced Trump’s previous attacks on Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, suggesting he may invoke her identity as a Black woman during the debate.  Harris said in the interview, which was taped last Wednesday, during her trip to New Hampshire, that she is hoping to make the case that Trump “tends to fight for himself” drawing the contrast with her own commitment to work on behalf of voters.  “What I intend to point out is what we, so many people know, and certainly, as I’m traveling the country in this campaign, he tends to fight for himself, not for the American people. And I think that’s going to come out during the course of the debate,” she said.  Harris has been in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania since Thursday preparing for tomorrow’s debate against Trump. As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump gear up to face off Tuesday in the presidential debate, both camps continue working to court voters. Here’s who you can expect to see and where: Donald Trump will join a National Faith Advisory Pre-Debate Prayer Call with Pastors Paula White, Jentezen Franklin, Lorenzo Sewell, and IFA President Dave Kubal at 8 p.m. ET. Kamala Harris: A pre-recorded radio interview with Vice President Harris will be aired on Monday morning. Later, at 4.40 p.m. ET Harris will depart Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and land in Philadelphia, PA ahead of Tuesday’s debate. Tim Walz: The Minnesota governor will travel to Dallas and in the afternoon will deliver remarks at a campaign reception on behalf of the Harris Victory fund. He’s also expected to campaign in Nevada tonight. Doug Emhoff and Gwen Walz: At 2:00 p.m. ET, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and First Lady of Minnesota Gwen Walz will deliver remarks in Raleigh from a Harris-Walz Campaign “Fighting for Freedom” Bus Tour Stop. At 4:05 p.m. ET, Emhoff will deliver remarks at a team Harris-Walz phone bank in Raleigh.  President Joe Biden: Biden will travel back to Washington, DC from Delaware. At 5:00 p.m. ET, Biden will deliver remarks from the White House to celebrate the Americans with Disabilities Act and to mark Disability Pride Month.  Former first lady Melania Trump narrated a short video claiming there are “efforts to silence my husband” as she prompted her new book. In the new video posted to X on Sunday, she said the results of 2020 election forever changed Americans’ lives. “It impacted our quality of life, cost of food, gasoline, safety and even the geopolitical landscape. America is more divided today than ever before. It has become increasingly apparent that there are significant challenges to free speech, as demonstrated by the efforts to silence my husband,” she said in a new video posted to X on Sunday that included a link to pre-order her memoir.  The comments are rare, as Melania Trump has maintained a low profile throughout the 2024 presidential campaign of her husband, Donald Trump, making only a handful of public appearances since the former president launched his third White House bid. Among them include: The former first lady’s office announced last month that her memoir, “Melania,” would be released this fall. The most important moment in the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump comes tomorrow, as the vice president prepares for what could be her only opportunity to directly confront a former president whose political dominance she is pledging to end. Their debate is particularly important for Harris, who is battling to define herself in voters’ eyes and keep up the positive momentum she’s enjoyed since becoming the Democratic Party’s new nominee this summer. The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be the first face-to-face encounter between Harris and Trump, who are locked in a tight race. For Harris, it’s a marquee moment to show Americans that she is ready to assume the presidency, a question very much on the minds of voters as the fall campaign intensifies. Trump, meanwhile, is eager to negatively shape voters’ perceptions of his Democratic rival and halt the gains she has made since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket in July. Harris has eliminated what for much of the year had been Trump’s lead over Biden in presidential polling. Both Harris and Trump are offering themselves as change agents of sorts. Harris has pitched herself as a clean break from a bitterly divisive era of politics dominated by Trump. The former president, though, points to Harris’ time in the Biden administration and says she bears the blame for inflation, higher mortgage rates and more. Read the full story. A new CNN Poll of Polls including polls conducted since the Democratic National Convention finds a tight race with no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris has an average of 49% support in the new Poll of Polls, while Trump has 47% across polls conducted between August 23 and Sept. 6. The new average is largely unchanged from the previous average, which found Harris at 50% to Trump at 48%. The Poll of Polls includes the four most recent national polls measuring the views of registered or likely voters in a 2024 presidential general election. Takeaways from one of the polls: A New York Times and Siena College poll of likely voters conducted from September 3 to 6 showed 48% say they support Trump to 47% for Harris, with no clear leader. Other takeaways from the Times-Siena poll: Former President Donald Trump said Sunday he would vote for a ballot measure in Florida that would legalize adult recreational marijuana use — a position that puts him at odds with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republican leaders in the state who oppose the initiative. He continued, “As president, we will continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking for state authorized companies, and supporting states rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.” Trump previously said he thought the ballot initiative in Florida would pass and that he thought adults in Florida shouldn’t be arrested for having “personal amounts” of marijuana on them. He also called for the Florida legislature to create laws that prohibit recreational marijuana use in public spaces. DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the GOP presidential primary but then endorsed the former president when he dropped out, has bashed the ballot initiative as “radical” and said earlier this year if it passed, “This state will start to smell like marijuana in our cities and towns.” Donald Trump limbered up for his debate with Kamala Harris by showing the extremism that risks playing into the vice president’s claim that he’s an “unserious man” who is an “extremely serious” threat if he’s returned to the White House. Trump warned he will jail election officials he considers cheats; is complaining Pennsylvania’s voting is a fraud; vowed to pardon January 6 rioters; railed against women who accused him of sexual misconduct; and spent hours in recent days on sometimes incoherent rants that raised questions about his state of mind. But new polling ahead of Tuesday’s showdown in Philadelphia shows the race tied up nationally, suggesting Harris’ momentum after replacing President Joe Biden on the ticket hasn’t resulted in a commanding edge. The tightness of the contest shows both Trump’s enduring appeal to tens of millions of Americans as he seeks a political comeback and the huge task facing Harris as she tries to save an election Democrats seemed doomed to lose before Biden bowed out. That makes tomorrow’s debate — the first since June’s consequential clash on CNN that eventually ended Biden’s campaign — the most critical scheduled event before Election Day. The way each candidate is preparing highlights the different paths Americans can choose in November and the sharp contrast in the style of the presidency that will ensue if Harris or Trump are at the Oval Office desk. Read the full analysis. The Harris campaign is taking aim at GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump’s former top officials who have distanced themselves from serving during his time as president in a new ad. The campaign appears to be attempting to get under Trump’s skin as he prepares to face off with Vice President Kamala Harris: It will run, the campaign said, on “Fox News and in the West Palm Beach and Philadelphia media markets on debate day.” It features first-person testimony from some of Trump’s top lieutenants, including his vice president, Mike Pence.  “Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,” Pence said in 2023. It also features his defense secretary, Mark Esper, who said in 2023 that Trump’s actions “(place) our nation’s security at risk.”  And his national security adviser, John Bolton, who warned days ago on CNN that Trump “will cause a lot of damage.” And his chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Mark Miley, who obliquely referenced Trump as he said in 2023, “We don’t take an oath to a king or queen, pirate or dictator. We don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator.”  The ad, titled “The Best People,” is part of an existing $370 million digital and TV advertising expenditure by the Harris campaign. Donald Trump on Sunday called on the FBI to investigate mail-in ballots in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania and made claims unsupported by evidence of widespread voter fraud as the former president escalates his efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election.  The post comes a day after Trump threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election, if he again wins the presidency in November.  Trump has routinely suggested he would weaponize the justice system to go after his political opponents if voters return him to the White House — threats that began after he was first indicted in his Manhattan hush money case more than a year ago.  Trump regularly spreads conspiracy theories about the 2020 election that he lost to President Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes and falsely claims there was widespread voter fraud.  Former President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election, if he again wins the presidency in November. Trump, again falsely claiming Democrats engaged in fraudulent behavior in 2020, said that he, attorneys and legal scholars are “watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely.” Trump’s threats of prosecution are part of his repeated efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election. He has routinely suggested he would weaponize the justice system to go after his political opponents if voters return him to the White House — threats that began after he was first indicted in his Manhattan hush money case more than a year ago. Trump, who regularly spreads conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and falsely claims there was widespread voter fraud, added on Saturday, “I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation!” Despite Trump’s repeated claims, the 2020 election was highly secure, and he lost to Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes. There is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the election outcome in any state. Read the full story. Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff went for a walk in Pittsburgh on Sunday as she remains in the area preparing for Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia. Asked by reporters if she was ready to debate former President Donald Trump, Harris gave a thumbs-up and said, “I’m ready.” Harris also stepped out for a break Saturday, briefly meeting voters at a local business. A July sit-down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became Vice President Kamala Harris’ debut on the world stage. Despite having met with more than 150 world leaders since becoming VP, this meeting felt different. “We have a lot to talk about,” she said, before dismissing reporters ahead of the meeting, a moment that captured the complicated dynamics that have colored her foreign policy ambitions, and offered a preview of the type of statesmanship she would pursue as president. Harris did not enter the job with vast experience on the world stage. Both advisers and foreign officials she’s interacted with say Harris managed to take what was essentially a supporting role and turn it into a crash course in foreign diplomacy. One former senior adviser described the vice president taking home massive briefing books and often peppering staffers with questions as she was briefed on multiple foreign policy issues. She began, some said, rather scripted and uncertain but emerged within her first year in office as a more confident voice. In meetings, she can appear alternatively warm – searching for commonalities over food or family – and steely, as she holds a firm line on US policy. Harris advisers argue nothing could have better prepared her to step onto the global stage, should she win the election in November, than her time as vice president.

Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar announced Sunday that he will be the headlining act for the Super Bowl LIX halftime show. Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump get ready for their first — and potentially only — presidential debate, Trump over the weekend threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election, if he again wins the presidency in November. Trump’s threats of prosecution — part of his repeated, baseless efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election — come as early voting will soon be underway in a number of states. The debate on Tuesday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be the first face-to-face encounter between Harris and Trump, who are locked in a tight race. Raging wildfires in California and Nevada have led to mandatory evacuations of thousands of homes as forecasters warn of record heat in the West for the next few days. In California, the Line Fire has consumed more than 20,000 acres after igniting at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains on Thursday. The blaze has more than quadrupled in size since Saturday morning and more than 1,800 fire personnel are battling the wildfire, which was zero percent contained as of Sunday evening, according to Cal Fire. And in Nevada, the Davis Fire — a dangerous, wind-driven blaze south of Reno — has burned about 6,500 acres and remains zero percent contained as of late Sunday. Classes have been canceled in schools across parts of central Kentucky today and residents have been urged to remain on high alert as the deep-woods search for a man suspected of opening fire along I-75 enters its third day. Joseph Couch, 32, has evaded capture since Saturday afternoon, when authorities say he fired an AR-15 from a cliff ledge on the side of the interstate about nine miles north of London, Kentucky, striking 12 cars and wounding five people. Though his motive is still unknown, the attack appeared to be a “random act” of violence, Laurel County Sheriff’s Deputy Gilbert Acciardo said, according to The Associated Press. Pope Francis arrived in the tiny Southeast Asian nation of East Timor earlier today for the penultimate stop on a marathon trip through Asia and the South Pacific for the 87-year-old pontiff. East Timor is one of the world’s youngest countries and has deep ties to the Catholic Church, which was influential in its fight for independence from Indonesia. The country of just 1.3 million people is the second-most Catholic country in the world, with 97% of the population identifying as Catholic — the highest share outside of the Vatican. But the issue of clerical sexual abuse is also hanging over this leg of the pope’s visit as revelations of mistreatment concerning high-profile East Timor clergy have emerged in recent years. Two years ago, the Vatican acknowledged that it had secretly disciplined East Timor bishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner Carlos Ximenes Belo after he was accused of sexually abusing boys decades before. Apple is set to introduce its first lineup of iPhones designed to feature generative artificial intelligence — which lets users create text and images — during its annual hardware event later today. The unveiling was teased with the cryptic motto of “it’s glow time” and the company is staying mum thus far on what it means. Apple has already hinted at some of the things the new AI features will be able to do, such as enabling more natural conversations with Siri, helping to draft emails, making it easier to find specific moments in your photo albums and incorporating users’ personal information into its responses.

Trump has lost $4 billion in Truth Social wipeout | CNN Business,"Updated 10:19 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T09:30:19.634Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/business/trump-stock-truth-social/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump’s social media company is in a deep slump that keeps getting worse, wiping out a huge chunk of his net worth. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) dropped last week to their lowest level since the merger that brought the owner of Truth Social public this spring. Despite a 7% rebound on Monday, Trump Media has lost nearlythree-quarters (72%) of its value since peaking at $66.22 on March 27. The selloff has erased significant amounts of wealth for investors — including Trump. Trump’s dominant stake of 114.75 million shares was valued at $6.2 billion on May 9. It’s now down to about $2.1 billion, a sharp drop that has knocked Trump off the Bloomberg Billionaires Index of the world’s 500 richest people. The wipeout reinforces concerns raised by experts who have repeatedly warned that Trump Media’s multi-billion-dollar price tag defies logic. The company is losing money, generating very little revenue and Truth Social remains a relatively tiny player in social media. “If this wasn’t Trump, this thing would be trading at $1,” Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, told CNN in a phone interview. In April, billionaire Barry Diller told CNBC that people who buy Trump Media stock are “dopes.” In June, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman told CNN that Trump Media is valued “absurdly out of the realm of normal.” Both Diller and Hoffman are Democratic megadonors. Beyond the Trump Media’s weak fundamentals, analysts have said there are likely other factors behind the company’s shrinking share price. Tuttle argues the fact that Vice President Kamala Harris is neck-and-neck with Trump in some polls is a major catalyst. Indeed, Trump Media has lost about half of its market value since President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris on July 21. “This stock is entirely a Trump-gets-elected play,” Tuttle said. “If Trump wins, this could be a viable company. But if he loses, I don’t know how this is a going concern.” Trump Media did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Of course, Trump Media is still sitting on more than $300 million in cash and equivalents — financial firepower it could use to make acquisitions and fund its operations. And although Trump Media brought in just $837,000 in revenue last quarter, it is building a streaming business that caters to conservatives. In August, Trump Media launched Truth+, a TV streaming platform on iOS, Android and the Web versions of Truth Social. Another cloud hovering over Trump Media is the looming expiration of the lock-up period that prevented Trump and other insiders from selling shares. Those restrictions are set to go away as soon as September 20, according to filings. That will free up insiders to sell shares if they wish to. However, experts have said it would be very difficult for Trump, the company’s majority shareholder, to sell all or even most of his shares without crashing the stock. It’s possible Trump Media’s stock market fortunes could turn, especially with the former president’s high-profile debate Tuesday with Harris. Still, Tuttle cautioned retail investors, even Trump fans, to tread lightly with this stock and pay attention to the fundamentals. “I am a huge believer that you must keep politics and profits separate,” he said. “If you’re holding onto this for dear life because you’re a Trump fan, that’s just stupid. You invest to make money.”"

Harris is holed up in Pittsburgh with staff to hone her skills for the test of facing Trump in a debate. Her choice of Pennsylvania for prep stresses the critical importance of a state she almost certainly needs to win to take the presidency. A source told CNN that her advisers are working out how she’ll deal with a rule that a candidate’s mic will be muted while their rival speaks. The vice president had pushed to overturn the restriction in the hope she could use her skills as a former prosecutor to dress down Trump in real time. But she told reporters, “I’m ready,” as she went for a stroll in the Steel City on Sunday with her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg reflected on Harris’ challenge as she tries to engage Americans who want to know more about her while dealing with a sometimes-unhinged force of nature like Trump. “It will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate,” Buttigieg said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It’s no ordinary proposition, not because Donald Trump is a master of explaining policy ideas and how they’re going to make people better off. It’s because he’s a master of taking any form or format that is on television and turning it into a show that is all about him.” A New York Times/Siena College poll published Sunday showed that 28% of likely voters need to know more about Harris, as opposed to just 9% who say the same of her rival. This presents possible room for growth for the vice president. But she is also facing pressure to explain policy reversals on issues such as immigration and fracking while showing more precision than she did in some testy interviews early in her vice presidency. And her unwillingness to submit to major media interviews — apart from one last month on CNN — means that a candidate who has sometimes struggled to articulate coherent arguments in high-pressure and spontaneous situations is coming into the debate without much recent experience of adversarial political combat. Trump’s Republican supporters have been pleading with him for days to drill down on issues such as the economy, immigration and national security and to avoid petulant behavior that could play into Harris’ argument that it’s time for the country to move on from the bitterness and chaos he represents for many voters. The GOP theory is that Harris, as a key member of an unpopular administration, is ill suited to act as an agent of political change. But Trump’s conduct heading into the debate explains the concern he will botch the clear contrast spelled out by Sen. Tom Cotton to CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” The Arkansas Republican said Sunday: “People remember that, when Donald Trump was in office, prices were low, wages were high, we had peace and stability around the world.” He added: “Kamala Harris, as vice president, has brought us record high inflation. We have a wide-open southern border and we have war everywhere you turn around in the world.” Trump, however, was unwilling to restrain himself in recent days. In the most ominous development, the ex-president on Saturday used his Truth Social network to blast what he called “Cheating and Skullduggery” in 2020 by Democrats, then pivoted to the 2024 election, warning, “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.” He lashed out at “Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials” who he said would be “prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.” There is no evidence that the 2020 election was corrupt. Trump’s multiple legal challenges were thrown out by judges and even his own attorney general, William Barr, said there was no widespread voter fraud. The fact that the ex-president tried to steal the last election makes his warnings that officials who do not echo his view of this one’s fairness an even more serious issue, and it bodes ill for the post-election period in November if Trump loses. Trump’s warnings also show the consequences of his successful legal gambits in forestalling accountability for his election interference — in a federal case and in Georgia — until after the coming election. If he regains power, he will almost certainly use his restored presidential authority and new legal maneuvers to dismiss special counsel Jack Smith’s case in Washington, DC, district court and to try to prevent the Georgia one from coming to trial. In another Truth Social post, Trump picked up on an interview by Tucker Carlson to claim with no evidence that 20% of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania are “fraudulent.” This is not the first time that the ex-president has seemed to be preparing a rationale to challenge the 2024 election if he loses. Trump’s debate prep is the most unorthodox of any modern presidential candidate. In other public appearances in recent days, the former president has indulged the wilder sides of his character in streams of consciousness that delight many of his supporters but raise questions about whether he has the discipline and clarity of thinking traditionally associated with the presidency. On Friday, in an extraordinary on-camera appearance in New York, he offered detailed and explicit appraisals of allegations of misconduct against him by women — part of a wider series of claims that he is an innocent victim of the weaponization of justice. His claims seem unlikely to improve his standing among women voters, among whom he trails Harris by 11 points, according to the New York/Times Siena poll. At a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday, Trump often embarked on confusing digressions — for instance about Al Capone and Hannibal Lecter — and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “chess player.” Trump promised he was the one thing standing between Americans and World War III. And he pledged to pardon people convicted and jailed “by the Harris regime” for trying to overturn the election on January 6, 2021 — a step that would short-circuit the justice system and legal accountability for crimes. In a self-indulgent aside, he praised one of his own speeches as delivered more “brilliantly” than anything since Franklin Roosevelt. His appearance was replete with exaggerations and distortions — although his conspiracy theories and falsehoods come at such a clip that they often escape scrutiny because of their sheer volume. At one point, Trump mistakenly referred to SpaceX and Tesla pioneer Elon Musk as “Leon.” When Biden made such slips, Trump and allies frequently argued that the president’s mental acuity was in question. But the 78-year-old Trump’s unrestrained public appearances and apparent belief in fantasies and unproven facts also raise questions about his capacity to serve as commander in chief and the threat he poses to constitutional democracy. His grip on the GOP means, however, that he’s driven anyone likely to raise such concerns out of the party — for instance former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who last week endorsed Harris, as did her father, former vice president Dick Cheney. Trump’s increasingly close relationship with Musk is also offering a preview of a potential second term for the ex-president. His promise to put Musk in charge of an effort to slash government regulations would mean the world’s richest man getting the chance to reshape federal rules and safeguards at a time when his businesses have massive interests that can be influenced by the government. This would create conflict-of-interest controversies that would dwarf those the Republican nominee encountered in his first term. Despite fresh evidence of Trump’s turbulent character and the success Harris has had so far in improving on Biden’s performance in the race, the latest polling shows no clear leader between them. Harris has an average of 49% support, while Trump has 47% in the latest CNN Poll of Polls, which includes surveys conducted between August 23 and September 6. The new average is largely unchanged from before the Democratic National Convention, when Harris was averaging 50% to Trump’s 48% among polls conducted between August 1 and 16."
Trump threatens prosecution of 2024 election officials who ‘cheated’ if he wins presidency | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:07 PM EDT, Sun September 8, 2024",2024-09-08T20:51:28.368Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/trump-threatens-prosecution-2024-election-officials/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election, if he again wins the presidency in November. Trump, again falsely claiming Democrats engaged in fraudulent behavior in 2020, said that he, attorneys and legal scholars are “watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely.” “WHEN I WIN,” Trump wrote in a post on his social network, Truth Social, that he later also shared on X, “those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.” Trump’s threats of prosecution — part of his repeated efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election — come as early voting will soon be underway in a number of states. Trump has routinely suggested he would weaponize the justice system to go after his political opponents if voters return him to the White House — threats that began after he was first indicted in his Manhattan hush money case more than a year ago. Trump, who regularly spreads conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and falsely claims there was widespread voter fraud, added on Saturday, “I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation!” Despite Trump’s repeated claims, the 2020 election was highly secure, and he lost to Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes. There is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome of the election in any state. In a post on Sunday, Trump also called on the FBI to investigate mail-in ballots in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania — which are set to go out to voters soon — and cited an interview with an “election expert” conducted by former Fox News host and far-right commentator Tucker Carlson that claimed a fifth of the state’s mail-in ballots were fraudulent. The former president has for years falsely claimed that mail-in voting leads to fraud and pointed to supposed examples in swing states, including Pennsylvania, in 2020. Despite these claims, Trump’s campaign over the summer launched a new program aimed at promoting absentee, mail-in and early in-person voting ahead of the November election. Election officials have been the victims of pervasive threats as the 2024 election draws closer, CNN has reported, and elections operations have beefed up security in the face of harassment of elections workers and disinformation about the voting process. Trump said Saturday he was eyeing everyone from lawyers and donors to voters. “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again,” he wrote. “Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country,” he added. Trump still faces his own charges over election interference stemming from efforts to subvert the 2020 election, including  a four-count indictment in his federal case. A separate election interference case against him in Fulton County, Georgia has been indefinitely paused. This story has been updated with new reporting."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff went for a walk in Pittsburgh on Sunday as she remains in the area preparing for Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia. Asked by reporters if she’s ready to debate former President Donald Trump, Harris gave a thumbs-up and said, “I’m ready.” Harris also stepped out for a break Saturday, briefly meeting voters at a local business. When the House Judiciary Committee held a field hearing on Friday to highlight the impact border security issues have on local communities, Vice President Kamala Harris was underlying their line of attack. Four months ago, when the panel held a similar field hearing in North Dakota, the vice president was not mentioned by name once. The shift, both in branding and messaging from the “Biden Border Crisis” to the “Biden-Harris Border Crisis” underscores how House Republicans are pivoting to specifically target Harris now that she is the Democratic nominee. As Congress embarks on a three-week sprint before its next recess, both parties return to Washington, DC, for a final messaging push dictated by the dynamics of the presidential race — while also trying to balance the critical September 30 government funding deadline. Democrats, who dismiss the GOP attacks as a last-ditch effort, are using their spots on committees to go on offense despite being in the minority. Earlier this month, House Oversight Committee Democrats launched an investigation into whether Trump received $10 million from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as part of his 2016 presidential campaign. And the Democratic working group that has spearheaded messaging against Project 2025, the controversial conservative policy blueprint, has a slew of messaging events planned over the next month, multiple sources told CNN. Read more here about the presidential election’s influence on Congress Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be in Philadelphia for the presidential debate on Tuesday as a surrogate for former President Donald Trump, a spokesperson for Kennedy tells CNN. Kennedy will appear in the spin room — where supporters of each candidate put their “spin” on the debate in conversations with media — on behalf of Trump, according to the spokesperson. Kennedy endorsed Trump and suspended his independent White House bid last month, urging his supporters to back the former president. Trump has said Kennedy would play a role in his administration if he is elected. Kennedy’s alliance with Trump came after a long history of attacking the former president. Trump’s running mate: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance will also hit the spin room Tuesday, after attending a Philadelphia debate watch party hosted by the Trump campaign, according to a source familiar with the plans. Earlier on Tuesday, Vance has a fundraiser in Greenville, North Carolina.  CNN’s Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updated with Vance’s plans for Tuesday evening. Former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said “it’s not helpful” in closing the GOP’s gap with women voters when the party’s vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, comments on childless women. Remember: Vance has been criticized for past comments about women and parenthood, particularly a 2021 comment saying Democratic politicians are “childless cat ladies.” Haley also referenced a more recently resurfaced comment Vance made in 2021 about the head of a powerful teacher’s union, who he suggested “should have some of her own” children if she wants to “brainwash” kids in school. On Trump: Haley said she disagreed greatly with former President Donald Trump’s style but was supporting him on policy — and in contrast to the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. Haley said she disagrees with Trump’s child care tax credits, favoring tax cuts across the board. She also disagreed with mandating insurance companies or the federal government to pay for fertility treatments. Haley said Trump’s team has not asked her to campaign or to advise on debate prep but said “I’m happy to be helpful,” if Trump asked. A July sit-down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became Vice President Kamala Harris’ debut on the world stage. Despite having met with more than 150 world leaders since becoming VP, this meeting felt different. “We have a lot to talk about,” she said, before dismissing reporters ahead of the meeting, a moment that captured the complicated dynamics that have colored her foreign policy ambitions, and offered a preview of the type of statesmanship she would pursue as president. Harris did not enter the job with vast experience on the world stage. Both advisers and foreign officials she’s interacted with say Harris managed to take what was essentially a supporting role and turn it into a crash course in foreign diplomacy. One former senior adviser described the vice president taking home massive briefing books and often peppering staffers with questions as she was briefed on multiple foreign policy issues. She began, some said, rather scripted and uncertain but emerged within her first year in office as a more confident voice. In meetings, she can appear alternatively warm – searching for commonalities over food or family – and steely, as she holds a firm line on US policy. Harris advisers argue nothing could have better prepared her to step onto the global stage, should she win the election in November, than her time as vice president. Read more about how Harris has carved out her foreign policy path here. Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock on Sunday said school shootings are not a “fact of life,” but rather a “fact of American life,” after four people were killed at Apalachee High School on Wednesday. The senator’s comments are in response to recent remarks made by Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who lamented school shootings being “a fact of life” and called for greater campus security. Warnock says he’ll continue to push for passing gun control laws, something he says Americans want and has bipartisan support, but said they “can’t even have a debate about that in the Senate.”   Warnock was in Winder, Georgia, on Friday and told CNN that he spoke with the family of 14-year-old victim Christian Angulo. Some background: Children ages 1 to 19 die from guns more than anything else in the US, studies show. American kids face the highest gun violence mortality rate among peer countries by far, according to a public health declaration by the US surgeon general earlier this year. In the US, there were 36.4 deaths per million people ages 1 to 19; in Canada, its 6.2 per million; in Australia, it’s 1.6 per million; and in the UK, it’s 0.5 per million, according to provisional data from 2022. A new CNN Poll of Polls including polls conducted since the Democratic National Convention finds a tight race with no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris has an average of 49% support in the new Poll of Polls, while Trump has 47% across polls conducted between August 23 and Sept. 6. The new average is largely unchanged from the previous average, which found Harris at 50% to Trump at 48%. The Poll of Polls includes the four most recent national polls measuring the views of registered or likely voters in a 2024 presidential general election. Takeaways from one of the polls: A New York Times and Siena College poll of likely voters conducted from September 3 to 6 showed 48% say they support Trump to 47% for Harris, with no clear leader. Other takeaways from the Times-Siena poll: Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he would go higher than the 28% capital gains tax hike proposed by Vice President Kamala Harris, but broadly defended her policy position changes in an interview Sunday. “I would go higher than that,” Sanders said of the tax hike on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Despite that disagreement, the progressive senator defended Harris’ recent shift to the center on key policies, saying he does not think she is “abandoning her ideals.” “I think she’s trying to be pragmatic and doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election,” Sanders said. And while he said the two do not always agree on the approach or the extent of policies, Sanders lauded Harris’ stances on making the child tax credit permanent, building affordable housing and passing the Pro Act to make it easier to join a union. Sanders also praised former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, for endorsing Harris. “Cheney and I agree on nothing, no issues, but what we do believe in is that the United States should retain its democratic foundations. And it’s not just Cheney. I think there is a significant number of Republicans that say, ‘Well, you know, I may not agree with the vice president on this issue or that issue, but I cannot support somebody who is a pathological liar, somebody who fomented a insurrection to overthrow the election returns,’” he said. Former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Sunday argued voting for former President Donald Trump or writing in a name in November is a decision to “abandon the Constitution.” Cheney said in an interview on ABC News’ “This Week” that too many elected Republicans have reduced the 2024 race to a “partisan choice” — but “that’s not what we’re facing this time around.” The onetime Republican leader, who said last week that she’ll vote for Vice President Kamala Harris, said she’s been “voting for 40 years. My first vote I ever cast was for Ronald Reagan in 1984. I’ve never voted for a Democrat.” Asked whether she’d be able to endorse Harris if Harris still promoted the same policy positions as in 2019, Cheney said the vice president has “changed in a number of very important ways on issues that matter” since she first ran for president. The former Wyoming congresswoman argued that Trump isn’t a conservative, pointing to his global tariffs proposal. Liz Cheney’s father, former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, has also endorsed Harris due to what he describes as Trump’s “threat to our republic.” Republican critics: Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders later told ABC that Liz Cheney is “significantly in the minority” among members of the GOP. “You don’t get to call yourself a conservative or a Republican when you support the most radical nominee that the Democrats have ever put up,” Sanders said. This post has been updated with comments by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders. CNN’s Sarah Davis contributed to this post. Former Vice President Dick Cheney’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris and a recent alleged Russian operation to interfere with the US election are not “going to make the difference” in the presidential race, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said Sunday.   “It is a remarkable time in politics — you have Dick Cheney endorsing a Democrat, you have a Kennedy endorsing a Republican,” Cotton said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” representing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “But in the end, endorsements are not going to make the difference in this race.”  The Arkansas senator’s comments come after Cheney said on Friday that he plans to vote for Harris over Donald Trump, warning that the former president “can never be trusted with power again.”  Asked about an alleged Russian government effort to influence the US presidential election — detailed by the Department of Justice last week — Cotton, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he doesn’t see it making a difference.   “People should not knowingly take money from the government of Russia or Iran or China or any other adversarial nation to try to influence the election,” Cotton responded. “But using money to try to promote memes or videos on the internet is not exactly going to make a huge difference,” he later added. Key context: Current and former US officials tell CNN that rather than relying on fake accounts and bogus online personas, Russia’s alleged efforts in 2024 have involved coopting real American influencers to try to push Russian narratives to US audiences, particularly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman says his prediction that replacing President Joe Biden in the 2024 election would help former president Donald Trump did not come to fruition, but maintained in an interview Sunday that Biden still could have won. Fetterman was one of Biden’s biggest defenders following the latter’s disastrous debate performance over the summer. The Pennsylvania senator lauded Democratic nominee Kamala Harris but said the election will come down to the vice president successfully presenting a “stark choice” between herself and Trump. State of the race: A new CNN Poll of Polls finds a tight contest between Trump and Harris, with no clear leader ahead of Tuesday’s presidential debate. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg — a one-time presidential candidate who ran for the Democratic nomination against Kamala Harris — says the vice president will need “almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate.” The former president and Harris will meet on the debate stage Tuesday in a showdown broadcast by ABC. Buttigieg called debating Trump an “extremely challenging task in the face of all of the distraction, whatever outrageous things he does and says, because they will require a response, and yet you can’t allow him to change the subject.” He described Harris as “extremely smart about getting to the core of an issue” and someone who focuses on “how is this going to affect somebody at home.” He also took a shot at Trump’s highly scrutinized response to a question on child care policy earlier this week, saying “it wasn’t clear whether he even understood the question.” Asked at an economic forum whether he would address rising child care costs for parents, Trump downplayed the problem and responded by touting his policy on tariffs, without clarifying how the two would be connected. As the election approaches, there’s another focus on Democrats’ minds: keeping control of the Senate. The party needs to hold all their seats — other than West Virginia, which is almost certain to flip to the GOP — in order to simply keep a 50-50 Senate. That means Democrats can’t afford a slip-up in a purple state like Pennsylvania, given they already have to defend seats in red states like Ohio and Montana. But in Pennsylvania, Sen. Bob Casey is bracing for a GOP onslaught. After a summer where he and his GOP opponent, David McCormick, have engaged in a brutal exchange of attacks in the marquee US Senate race in Pennsylvania, leaving the race in a dead heat, Republicans are preparing to drop more than $100 million across the airwaves in the final two months of the campaign. While Casey still predicted he would pull off a November victory and contended that he didn’t “care what they spend,” he said: “I don’t have a personal super PAC funded by Wall Street billionaires. … It’s going to be a really difficult race to win.” Read more about how Democrats are hoping to hold on to the Senate here. Vice President Kamala Harris will return to the campaign trail in North Carolina and Pennsylvania following next week’s debate, looking to harness what she hopes will be a wave of momentum following the televised showdown. The stops are part of a battleground state push by Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and their respective spouses dubbed the New Way Forward tour.  The Harris campaign says the swing will include events “in every media market in every battleground state in just four days.” Here are some of the stops the team will make: “With early voting about to begin and less than 60 days until Election Day, our campaign will take the vice president’s message directly to the voters wherever they are – on the airwaves, on the doors, and online,” Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler said. The campaign will also begin airing a new television ad in battlegrounds focused on Harris’ economic proposals to lower costs.  Harris has been hunkered down in Pittsburgh this weekend preparing for the debate, keeping her mostly off the campaign trail. She did make some local stops in the area on Saturday. The start of voting in North Carolina, which was scheduled to begin Friday with the mailing of absentee ballots, has been delayed due to legal proceedings surrounding the removal of former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot. An appeals court ordered the state to remove Kennedy’s name last week, but North Carolina’s State Board of Elections has now appealed that ruling to the state Supreme Court. In its appeal, lawyers for the elections board said the change to the ballot at such a late stage has thrown the “elections process into chaos,” and that while it has already begun recoding ballots without RFK Jr., a quick reversal by the state’s highest court could still “avoid most of the irreparable harm.” Why this matters: Kennedy dropped out of the race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Removing his name from the ballot is part of a strategy to ensure voters don’t still vote for Kennedy despite the independent’s urging to now back his unlikely ally. North Carolina’s Democratic-controlled State Board of Elections voted along party lines last week to reject Kennedy’s request to remove his name, saying it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting. Kennedy challenged the decision in court, and that’s led to the events now holding up the state’s electoral process. Former President Donald Trump touched on familiar talking points as he spoke during a campaign rally at an airfield in central Wisconsin on Saturday, projecting confidence about Tuesday’s debate against Vice President Kamala Harris while shouting out allies Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Here’s some of what Trump said during the rally: Changing the 25th Amendment: Trump called for modifying the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and said if a vice president covers for the “incapacity of the president” they should be removed from office. It was part of an attack on Harris, who he accuses of a “cover-up” of President Joe Biden’s fitness for office before he eventually dropped out of the race. On the debate: Trump said the country is run by “stupid people” and that we “found that out at the debate with Joe (Biden).” “We’re going to find it out again on Tuesday night. Is anybody going to be watching?” Trump asked the crowd. The former president predicted that pundits would say he lost the debate, even “if I destroy her.” Praising RFK Jr.: Trump repeatedly praised Kennedy, saying that with his help, “we’ll take on the corruption at the FDA, the CDC, World Health Organization and other institutions of public health.” Kennedy, the former independent presidential candidate who has embraced conspiracy theories about vaccines and other issues, has been positioned by the former president to helm a panel investigating chronic health problems in a potential second Trump administration. On Boeing and SpaceX: Trump said the Boeing Starliner crew being stuck in space is “embarrassing,” and that Musk, the SpaceX CEO, is “going to have to save them.” Trump continued his public praise of the tech billionaire amid the tightening alliance between the two men.  “He’s very good at what he does,” Trump said of Musk. “Leon’s going to send up a rocket, he looks forward to it,” he added, apparently misstating his ally’s first name. The praise of Musk comes days after Trump announced he would appoint Musk to head a newly created government efficiency commission if reelected. Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Rep. Liz Cheney, calling the prominent Republicans’ backing a rebuke of the “attempts to kind of divide us as Americans.” “I’m honored to have their endorsement,” she told reporters during a visit to a spice shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “They both as leaders who are well-respected are making an important statement that it’s OK and if not important to put country above party,” she added. Harris says she’s ready for debate: Harris visited Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh as a brief respite from debate preparations, where she greeted supporters and perused merchandise. Harris told reporters the “best part” of debate preparations was getting a chance to visit the store. Harris suggested her main focus in next week’s debate with former President Donald Trump is to communicate with voters that it’s “time to turn the page on divisiveness.” When asked if she’s ready to debate Trump, she replied, “Yes I am. Yes.” During her visit to the store, Harris greeted roughly a dozen customers and took a tour, guided by one of the shop’s employees."
Harris prepares for the showdown she’s long sought with Trump as he takes more informal approach | CNN Politics,"Published 5:45 PM EDT, Sun September 8, 2024",2024-09-08T21:45:27.635Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate/index.html,"The most important moment in the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump comes this week, as the vice president prepares for what could be her only opportunity to directly confront a former president whose political dominance she is pledging to end. Their Tuesday night debate is particularly important for Harris, who is battling to define herself in voters’ eyes and keep up the positive momentum she’s enjoyed since becoming the Democratic Party’s new nominee this summer. The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be the first face-to-face encounter between Harris and Trump, who are locked in a tight race. For Harris, it’s a marquee moment to show Americans that she is ready to assume the presidency, a question very much on the minds of voters as the fall campaign intensifies. “Look, it’s time to turn the page on the divisiveness,” she said during a weekend stop in Pittsburgh, taking a break from her debate preparations. “It’s time to bring our country together, chart a new way forward.” Trump, meanwhile, is eager to negatively shape voters’ perceptions of his Democratic rival and halt the gains she has made since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket in July. Harris has eliminated what for much of the year had been Trump’s lead over Biden in presidential polling. Both Harris and Trump are offering themselves as change agents of sorts. Harris has pitched herself as a clean break from a bitterly divisive era of politics dominated by Trump. The former president, though, points to Harris’ time in the Biden administration and says she bears the blame for inflation, higher mortgage rates and more. Trump’s campaign and his allies have accused Harris of avoiding policy particulars. But Trump’s incoherent answer last week to a question about how he would make child care more affordable was a vivid reminder that the former president has long brushed aside policy details and questions about the practicality of his proposals. Trump has also lobbed racist and lewd attacks against Harris, including falsely claiming in July that she “happened to turn Black” a few years ago (she’s the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants) and sharing on social media references to her former relationship with onetime San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. Whether Trump makes similar comments — and how Harris responds — could shape voters’ perceptions of their clash Tuesday. The debate, moderated by ABC anchors Linsey Davis and David Muir, is scheduled to last 90 minutes. Like the CNN debate between Trump and Biden in June, candidates’ microphones will be turned on when it’s their turn to speak and muted otherwise. Those rules — agreed to by the Biden and Trump campaigns — have frustrated Harris, who hoped to tap into her skills as a former prosecutor during any onstage engagements with Trump. “Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the Harris campaign said Wednesday in a letter to ABC News agreeing to the debate. The debate comes just before early voting begins in several key states. Polls have shown a tight race nationally and in key battlegrounds — including the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. Both campaigns have paid particular attention to Pennsylvania and Georgia, where recent CNN polling found no clear leader between the candidates. Should Trump hold North Carolina, a state he’s won twice, victories in Pennsylvania and Georgia could push him past the 270 electoral vote threshold even if he does not win any of the other battleground states. Harris got a jolt of good news late last week, when her campaign announced it had pulled in almost triple her Republican rival’s fundraising haul in August — $361 million to Trump’s $130 million — entering September with $404 million in cash reserves for the final two-month sprint to November. That sum far surpasses the $295 million Trump’s political operation says it has in the bank. A Sunday New York Times/Siena College poll, however, underscored the importance of the fight over defining Harris. The survey, which showed the two candidates about evenly matched nationally, suggested that a sizable share of voters still need more information about the vice president: 28% of likely voters said they feel like they need to learn more about Harris, while just 9% said the same about Trump. The poll also offered some potential warnings for Harris. While 61% of likely voters said they thought the next president should represent a “major change” from Biden, just 25% said they thought Harris represented such a change, while 53% said Trump did. The same poll found that 47% of likely voters found Harris too liberal, despite her attempts to moderate in recent weeks, compared with 32% who said Trump is too conservative. The two candidates have taken drastically different approaches to preparing for their Tuesday showdown. No presidential nominee in the modern age has done more televised general election debates than Trump. Harris and her team have been carefully studying all six of them — three with Hillary Clinton in 2016, two with Biden in 2020, and another with Biden in June — as she prepares for her turn onstage. Harris has spent the days leading up to the debate hunkered down with aides at a hotel in Pittsburgh, making only occasional, brief public appearances. But aides said she has been thinking about a debate with Trump since the moment Biden ended his bid for reelection in late July. “I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage,” Harris told reporters last month. “I’m ready. Let’s go.” She’s been reading briefing papers about Trump’s comments, positions and even the insults he’s directed at her, aides said, as well as familiarizing herself with how Trump comported himself with his two previous Democratic opponents, particularly Clinton. Harris has spoken extensively to both Clinton and Biden about debating Trump, hoping to benefit from their experiences. And she began telegraphing her approach to Trump even before her nomination became official, telling a crowd in Atlanta in late July: “If you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.” A strategy for Harris, aides said, is not only to stand up to the former president, but to make the case that it’s time for the country to move beyond the Trump era. Any of his taunts on race are expected to be diminished and dismissed as the “same old, tired playbook,” as Harris said during her sit-down interview with CNN last month. While many candidates have outwardly bristled at debate preparations, aides said Harris is digging into the practice sessions with mock debates against a Trump stand-in, longtime Clinton aide Philippe Reines, and preparing like she did during her years as a prosecutor. Karen Dunn, a Washington lawyer who has helped Democratic candidates prepare for debates for more than a decade, is running the practice sessions for Harris. Dunn, who worked with Clinton ahead of her encounters with Trump in 2016, got to know Harris when she prepared her to face Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking,” Harris said at one point during that debate, delivering a line that could be reprised on Tuesday if she is faced with any interruptions. “If you don’t mind letting me finish, we can have a conversation. OK? OK.” In recent days Trump has ribbed Harris over her preparations and claimed that his debate performance won’t get a fair review. “If I destroy her in the debate, they’ll say, ‘Trump suffered a humiliating defeat tonight,’” the former president said at a Saturday campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin. Trump, who argued he doesn’t need formal preparation such as mock debates, has been meeting with senior advisers, policy experts and outside allies to ready himself for Tuesday. The “policy discussions” — the Trump campaign’s version of debate prep — largely mirror those the former president held in the weeks leading up to his June 27 debate with Biden, sources familiar with the meetings told CNN. Trump senior adviser Jason Miller has been handling the meetings, which have included sessions with former Trump administration official Stephen Miller, Trump campaign policy adviser Vincent Haley, and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, among others. The sessions have largely focused on helping Trump sharpen his messaging on a range of issues, from the economy to immigration and American democracy at large. The Trump campaign also deliberately scheduled a slate of events in the days leading up to the debate, such last week’s policy speech to the Economic Club of New York and his town hall with Fox News, in an effort to have him hone his messaging in public, his advisers said. People close to Trump argue one of the most crucial aspects of his Tuesday matchup with Harris is ensuring the former president does not appear overly aggressive toward her and strikes the right tone. As with his June 27 debate with Biden, Trump’s advisers and allies have been encouraging him to appear more restrained while onstage. However, many privately acknowledge that will be even more important this time. Not only is Harris a more popular candidate than Biden was then, but she is also a woman, and the optics of particular attacks will resonate differently, they say. Gabbard, who recently endorsed Trump, has been a key player in that effort. The Hawaii Independent was among the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders who challenged Harris on the debate stage. She has been working with Trump to help him better understand Harris’ debate style. Trump’s advisers believe Gabbard’s attacks on the then-California senator — particularly the scrutiny of her record as a prosecutor — helped undermine Harris’ candidacy in 2019. The former president’s team has told him to specifically needle Harris on the issues where she has changed her position. “We want to keep him steered toward hitting her record. On fracking, on her flip flops, and show that she is just as responsible for the Biden administration’s failed policies as Biden is,” one adviser said. Those helping Trump prepare have also directed him to focus his answers on the core policy issues where he polls higher than Harris, such as the economy, immigration and crime, sources familiar with the meetings said. “The most important part is finding pivots, finding ways to be critical of her, deflecting attacks from her,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. “It’s not about her interrupting him or how she’ll act. It’s about him being on target on his responses on policy. That’s been the main focus.”"
