Elon Musk boosts fake Trump rally bomb threat and false claims about the election | CNN Business,"Published 6:47 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T22:47:29.583Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/media/elon-musk-trump-rally-bomb-election-misinformation/index.html,"Elon Musk is using his social media platform to promote misinformation about the presidential candidates in the lead up to the November election, amplifying false claims Wednesday about a Trump rally bomb threat and immigrants eating pets in Ohio. While Musk’s posting of provocative, incendiary content on X is nothing new, the speed with which he has promoted false claims in recent days is striking given the breadth of Musk’s digital reach, with his posts regularly finding their way atop users’ feeds. The most prominent of Musk’s conspiratorial posts came in the wake of an alleged second assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, after which Musk wrote in a now-deleted X post that “no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.” After much backlash, Musk, who has pledged his support for Trump, ultimately deleted his post, stating that it was meant as a “joke.” During the same weekend, however, Musk also joined a chorus of conspiracy-minded X users circulating a hoax “affidavit” from a purported “whistleblower” that claimed last week’s ABC News debate was rigged to help Kamala Harris. ABC has since confirmed the typo-ridden document was fake. Then on Wednesday, Musk reshared a bogus claim that a bomb had been discovered near the site of a planned Trump rally in Long Island. Police said in a statement that “reports of explosives being found at the site are unfounded.” While Musk’s pithy reaction to the fake threat is still live on X, the initial post has since been deleted. Musk’s own post has been earmarked with a crowd-sourced “community notes” fact-check that makes clear the claim was false. Still, in the post’s first two and a half hours, it garnered 4.3 million views and was reshared 9,800 times. Also on Wednesday, Musk reshared a video falsely claiming the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, admitted in March that there had been reports of Haitian immigrants eating pets, captioning the post “Always Be Cheating News,” a clear knock on ABC’s moderators, who had fact-checked Trump’s false claims on the matter at the debate. The edited video instead showed a Springfield resident sharing that he had heard unconfirmed reports about domesticated animals being harmed. Both the city’s mayor and manager both state during the hearing they have seen no proof of such claims. Musk’s post, which boosted false claims about Haitian immigrants that have been promoted by Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, leading to dozens of bomb threats at schools and municipal buildings in the Ohio city, garnered more than 7.9 million views and 36,000 reshares. Hours later, Musk shared a map purporting to be from Nate Silver, the renowned statistician and FiveThirtyEight founder, projecting a 312-226 electoral college victory for Trump in November, saying the election was “trending well.” The map, however, was a fake. The real map from Silver’s newsletter platform, “Silver Bulletin,” published Wednesday shows several states in play, including Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Silver himself noted that “the race is really a tossup” in the post. Meanwhile, in simulations from FiveThirtyEight, which Silver parted ways with last year, Harris was forecast to win the election in 64 out of 100 simulations. X did not respond to a CNN request for comment Wednesday on Musk’s posts. Musk is far from the only figure spreading false information on the platform, though he is easily one of its biggest voices. Many of the bogus claims propelled by the billionaire in recent days were also buoyed by other major right-wing voices. Since acquiring Twitter in 2022, Musk has gutted the company’s moderation teams and altered its policies, allowing misinformation and hate speech to spread on the platform. Musk also reinstated the accounts of previously banned conspiracy theorists, created financial incentives to post viral content, and ended the legitimacy of verified badges. But the combination of Musk’s 198 million-strong following coupled with an algorithm boosting his posts has elevated false claims that would typically be confined to less visible corners of the internet. Though Musk has styled himself as a free-speech absolutist, his tendency to champion posts from fringe, right-wing voices while regularly attacking news organizations and journalists presents a major issue for voters seeking reliable information online during an already-turbulent election period."
Iranian hackers sent stolen Trump campaign information to people associated with Biden campaign | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:04 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T22:26:04.473Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/iranian-hackers-trump-biden-campaigns/index.html,"Iranian hackers sent unsolicited information they stole from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to people who were affiliated with Joe Biden’s campaign over the summer, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a joint statement that in late June and early July, Iranian malicious cyber actors “sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails.” There is no indication that Biden’s staff ever replied, the statement says. A spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said that “a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails.” “We have cooperated with the appropriate law enforcement authorities since we were made aware that individuals associated with the then-Biden campaign were among the intended victims of this foreign influence operation,” said Morgan Finkelstein, national security spokesperson for the Harris campaign. “We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt. We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.” A campaign official told CNN that “the material was not used.” The Trump campaign said in a statement that Harris and Biden “must come clean on whether they used the hacked material,” claiming it’s “further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election” to help the Democratic ticket. During a rally Wednesday night in New York, Trump claimed without evidence that Biden was involved in the hack despite the law enforcement statement. “Iran hacked into my campaign. I don’t know what the hell they found. I’d like to find out, couldn’t have been too exciting, but they gave it to the Biden campaign. I can’t believe it – oh yes I can,” he said. Iranian government-linked hackers have also previously unsuccessfully tried to hack the Biden-Harris campaign, according to US officials and private experts, but the activity disclosed Wednesday appears to be another Iranian attempt to disseminate information stolen from the Trump campaign. Along with Russia, Iran has emerged as one of the most aggressive foreign powers trying to influence the 2024 US presidential election, according to US intelligence officials. And in doing so, Iran is using a hack-and-leak playbook that Russia used to try to sway the 2016 US election. During the 2016 election, Trump famously called for Russia to “find” tens of thousands of emails belonging to Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic presidential candidate. Russian military intelligence hackers did steal emails from Clinton campaign officials and the Democratic National Committee and sent them to WikiLeaks in a bid to undermine Clinton’s candidacy, according to US intelligence and Justice Department reports. CNN previously reported that Iranian government-backed hackers this summer stole internal Trump campaign documents and shared them with news organizations. The law enforcement statement Wednesday said that the hackers’ efforts to send information to US media outlets have continued. The hack is one of several efforts by the Iranian government attempting to “stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process,” the statement said. Beginning on July 22, Politico reported,  it had received emails that contained internal communications from a senior Trump campaign official and a research dossier the campaign had put together on Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The New York Times and The Washington Post later reported that they, too, had been sent a similar cache, including a 271-page document on Vance dated February 23 and labeled “privileged & confidential,” that the outlets said was based on publicly available information. The Iranian hackers did breach the email account of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone to target campaign staff in June, CNN has reported. US officials believe the hackers work for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Investigators believe the suspected Iranian hackers breached Stone’s account and then used that email account to try to break into the account of a senior Trump campaign official as part of a persistent effort to access campaign networks. The Iranian government has denied US allegations that it is trying to meddle in the November election. Russia, meanwhile, has conducted its own covert influence operations aimed at denigrating Harris’ campaign, according to US officials. Russian operatives have in recent weeks intensified their online attacks on Harris’ campaign by producing and disseminating videos promoting “outlandish conspiracy theories” aimed at stoking US racial and political divisions, Microsoft researchers said this week. At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday on foreign meddling in US elections, tech executives from Microsoft, Meta and Google touted their work to shut down fake accounts set up by Russian, Iranian and Chinese operatives on their platforms. But multiple lawmakers on the committee worried that not enough was being done by the tech platforms on the issue. The panel invited social media platform X to testify, but the company did not send a representative, according to Senate Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner. An X spokesperson told CNN in an email that its invited witness to the hearing was its former head of global affairs, Nick Pickles, who resigned on September 6. US tech companies have made “uneven” progress in curbing foreign disinformation on their platforms since the 2016 election, Warner said at the hearing. “Too many of the companies have dramatically cut back on their own efforts to prohibit false information [from foreign sources],” the Virginia Democrat said. Microsoft President Brad Smith told the lawmakers that “every day we know that there is a presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.” “But this has also become an election of Iran versus Trump, and Russia versus Harris,” he added. This story has been updated with additional details."
Analysis: Why are we still talking about cat memes in the 2024 campaign? | CNN Politics,"Published 5:44 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T21:44:14.895Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/cat-memes-election-trump-what-matters/index.html,"Far be it from anyone to identify a defined strategy in the cat memes that have overtaken the American political conversation in a pivotal election year. But it’s worth considering why, rather than move on from insults against “childless cat ladies” and false stories about Haitian migrants eating cats in Ohio, former President Donald Trump’s campaign and his allies keep the controversies simmering. Beyond Trump’s general refusal to ever admit an error, do they see an upside in stirring the pot? Why else, the day after the Republican mayor of Springfield, Ohio, said at a press conference that he’d prefer neither campaign turn his city into a background for a political event, would Vivek Ramaswamy, the Ohio-based businessman who is one of Trump’s most vocal and spirited supporters, announce he would hold a town hall in the city? Never mind the state’s Republican governor, who also counseled against a campaign visit, called out state troopers to city schools to ease concern about scores of bomb threats. Why else, rather than move on from mean critiques of women without biological children, would Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders open a town hall event with Trump in Michigan on Tuesdaywith a not-so-subtle reference to Vice President Kamala Harris’ personal life? Sanders began what could have been a touching anecdote by noting that her own children keep her humble. But then she aimed a barb at Harris, who, “unfortunately,” according to Sanders, “doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.” Harris is a stepmother. Intentional or not, the insult cued a new round of stories about how the Trump campaign doesn’t seem to mind turning off women voters. The Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson said on CNN that she views Sanders as somebody “who’s a potentially really great messenger to women, to young moms, across the country.” That’s probably why Trump’s campaign picked Sanders to interview the former president during the town hall event. Women voters have shifted away from Trump since Harris entered the race, according to polls. But the need to “twist the knife in a little bit to Vice President Harris” contradicts that message, according to Anderson. Perceptions of the election are so set in stone that it may not matter who Trump, his running mate Sen. JD Vance or any other Republican offends. CNN’s senior data reporter, Harry Enten, said in an appearance on CNN Tuesday that pretty much everyone has made up their minds. “In fact, it’s the lowest level of undecideds that we’ve seen in polling at this point this entire 21st century.” He was referring to an aggregate of polling, but Enten later pointed me to a September New York Times/Siena College poll that tells a similar story. Enten argued that one difficulty in speaking to this tiny but consequential sliver of voters is that the campaigns might not know what they’re looking for. While most, 30%, cite the economy as their top issue, a large chunk of the undecided voters, 28%, he pointed out, say they don’t have a top issue. “What exactly are you going to talk about to the folks who say, ‘Wait a minute, we don’t have a top issue?’” Enten wondered. Will the cat memes pierce through? Another thing that separates this sliver of undecided voters from the rest of the country, Enten noted, is that large majorities of Harris supporters (70%) and Trump supporters (72%) say this is the most important election in their lifetime. Only about a quarter of undecided voters see this election as the most important in their lifetime. There’s also an argument that, in particular when it comes to the Springfield story, any coverage of the immigration issue benefits Trump – even when he’s saying things that are untrue about Haitian migrants, drawing the gentle rebuke of Ohio’s governor or unintentionally misgendering a Puerto Rican reggaeton star, as Trump did at one recent rally in Las Vegas. Trump assumed that the musician Nicky Jam is a woman. He’s not. So it was somewhat uncomfortable when Trump said of Jam, “She’s hot!,” and was then joined by a tattooed man in a MAGA hat. Jam, by the way, is not the only Puerto Rican musician to endorse Trump – something that has not gotten as much attention as Taylor Swift’s or Billie Eilish’s endorsements of Harris, but could in hindsight have an effect in Philadelphia, where there is a Puerto Rican population. Pennsylvania doesn’t have the largest Puerto Rican population in the continental US, but it is a major swing state. Every day the political conversation is tied to immigration is a winner for Trump, argued Lance Trover, who was an adviser to the short-lived presidential campaign of North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. In an appearance on CNN Wednesday, Trover noted that polling suggests a majority of Americans support the idea of mass deportation, for instance, even though the Haitians in Springfield are in the US legally. “I’m guessing the Trump campaign is wagering that Americans have moved on from the dogs and the cats and the memes, and they are wagering that Americans as a whole are looking at this community and asking themselves a foundational question: ‘What if 10, 20, 30,000 people moved into my community?’ And that’s a fair discussion to have across the country,” Trover said. Pushing verifiably incorrect stories seems like a bold wager, even if it does keep the focus on immigration. Insulting women seems even bolder in an election that could come down to relatively few votes in a handful of states. Anderson wrote in The New York Times that while Harris may have an edge in nationwide polling and Democrats remain fired up and united behind Harris after her strong debate performance, it’s not yet clear that the race has materially changed. Polling still suggests super tight races in those pivotal states. “It’s of course better to have your side more energized than your opponent’s, but an enthusiastic vote doesn’t count more than a begrudging one so long as they both turn out,” Anderson wrote. While Trump and Vance frequently gripe about which comments get coverage in the media, it’s hard to ignore that they keep teasing out these controversies with their comments and actions. There is evidence that the attacks on Harris’ personal life are having an effect, but not a good one for Trump, according to the anti-Trump Republican strategist Sarah Longwell, who appeared Wednesday on “The Lead” with CNN’s Jake Tapper. “Every time I do a focus group with swing voters, they bring up JD Vance talking about childless cat ladies. Like, this is the kind of thing that’s breaking through and is really causing, I think, independent voters to say … ‘Why do they keep attacking women?’” “I’ve never seen a campaign do more to alienate … the single largest voting bloc in an election,” Longwell said."
Sarah Huckabee Sanders is latest Trump ally to make dig at Harris over biological kids | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:40 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T20:13:02.515Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/sarah-huckabee-sanders-harris-kids/index.html,"Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders reignited the controversy over how allies of Donald Trump talk about stepmothers and childless women when she told supporters of the former president Tuesday night that Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything to keep her humble. While introducing Trump at a Flint, Michigan, town hall, Sanders said her three children serve as a “permanent reminder of everything that is at stake in this country” ahead of the election. “My kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble,” said Sanders, the first female governor of Arkansas and Trump’s former White House press secretary. “You would think after four years of straight failure, she would know a little humility. Unfortunately, she doesn’t.” The comments come as the Trump campaign attempts to narrow the gap with Harris among female voters. Sanders is one of several former Trump staffers who have attempted to vouch for the former president among women, despite his long history of sexual misconduct allegations and the fact that he was found liable of sexual abuse and defamation last year. During her time in the White House, Sanders, who at times faced sexist comments about her appearance, defended Trump after he was criticized for attacks on female politicians. Her remarks Tuesday, in which she argued that children serve as reminders of what matters in an election and alluded to the vice president’s lack of biological kids, are reminiscent of comments made by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, a longtime critic of those, particularly elected officials, without children. The Ohio senator has railed against a “childless elite” in Washington, who he has argued doesn’t have a “direct stake” in the future of the country, and has said that the US was being run by “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.” Vance has also said the Democratic Party has become “anti-family and anti-child.” Those comments, made before he joined Trump on the Republican presidential ticket, have been widely criticized by members of both parties. Pop star Taylor Swift alluded to the Vance lines in her endorsement of Harris, signing off as a “Childless Cat Lady.” Trump has since said, “I hate Taylor Swift.” Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Sanders, said the governor was referring to the Biden-Harris administration’s economic and border security policies. “Vice President Harris, without winning any votes, and after driving up prices by 20% and allowing nearly ten million illegal border crossings, is claiming she alone can solve America’s problems,” Dubke said in a statement to CNN. “That’s the lack of humility Governor Sanders was referencing.” The Harris and Trump campaigns did not respond to requests for comment. But second gentleman Doug Emhoff, speaking at a campaign fundraiser in Brooklyn on Wednesday, defended “our big, beautiful, blended family” and tied Vance’s comments to what he said was Trump’s agenda. “We know what they’re really trying to do. It’s Dobbs, it’s Project 2025, it’s spreading hate and trying to pit women against each other, trying to pit us all against each other,” he said. “But I’ve got news for him. Women in this country are sick and tired of weak men trying to take away their fundamental rights and then gaslight you about it.” He continued: “The women in this country will never humble themselves before Donald Trump.” While Harris does not have biological children, she has two stepchildren – Cole and Ella Emhoff – through her 10-year marriage to second gentleman Doug Emhoff. “We might not look like other families in the White House, but we are ready to represent all families in America,” Cole Emhoff said in a video introducing his father at last month’s Democratic National Convention. The second gentleman’s former wife, Kerstin Emhoff, has continually defended Harris and her role in their blended family. “Cole and Ella keep us inspired to make the world a better place. I do it through storytelling. Kamala Harris has spent her entire career working for the people, ALL families,” she wrote on social media Tuesday in response to Sanders’ remarks. “That keeps you pretty humble.” At the core of the Democratic backlash to the remarks by Vance, and now Sanders, however, has been that women’s value and contributions to their communities shouldn’t be based on whether they have had children. And Democrats slam the related GOP rhetoric as a distraction. “When you have no substance, you have to resort to superficiality,” said Donna Brazile, a Harris ally and veteran Democratic political strategist. Brazile pointed to Vance missing recent Senate votes to temporarily expand the child tax credit and to protect and expand access to in vitro fertilization, which Senate Republicans blocked. Members of Sanders own party have also balked at her remarks at the Flint event. Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and CNN senior political commentator, said that he understood the value of stepparents, having been raised for several years by his stepmother. “My kind of Republican Party welcomes everyone,” Jennings said on CNN’s “NewsNight with Abby Phillip” on Tuesday. “We do encourage families, we encourage life, but we also encourage everybody to do what’s best for themselves in their own personal situation and respect other people’s choices.” Brian Lanza, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign who was also raised by a stepmother, told Phillip he was “offended” by the comment and “disappointed” in Sanders for saying that. “I’m sure I’m going to get criticism from the campaign, but I have to defend somebody who’s a stepmom. It’s a tough job,” Lanza said. “We should reward that and speak of that in a high tone.” This story has been been updated with comments from second gentleman Doug Emhoff."
Teamsters won’t endorse in presidential race after releasing internal polling showing most members support Trump | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:23 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T19:13:05.691Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/teamsters-will-not-endorse-us-president/index.html,"The International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse a presidential candidate on Wednesday after releasing internal polling that showed a majority of its members supported former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. It’s the first time in nearly three decades that the union has not endorsed a presidential candidate. “Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business,” Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said in a statement. “We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries – and to honor our members’ right to strike – but were unable to secure those pledges.” Ahead of the decision, the Teamsters shared internal data showing that a majority of members supported Trump over Harris. According to an electronic member poll that was initiated after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, about 60% of members believed the union should endorse Trump while 34% supported Harris. About 6% said they supported another candidate. “It’s a great honor. They’re not going to endorse the Democrats. That’s a big thing,” Trump said during a campaign stop in New York City on Wednesday. “Democrats automatically have the Teamsters. They took a vote, and I guess I was at 60% or more, and that’s a great honor.” Harris met with Teamsters leaders on Monday. O’Brien had a prime-time speaking slot at this summer’s Republican National Convention but did not appear at the Democratic convention the following month. The Teamsters, which represents truck drivers, freight workers and other workers, is the last major labor union to announce a presidential endorsement. The nation’s other major labor organizations, including the American Federation of Teachers and the United Auto Workers, have backed Harris. The last time the Teamsters sat out a presidential election was 1996. It endorsed Democratic nominees in the ensuing six elections, including Trump’s opponents Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. The union last backed a Republican presidential candidate in 1988, with an endorsement of George H.W. Bush. CNN previously reported that rank-and-file union membership had large pockets of Trump support, even as major labor leaders endorsed Harris. Before Biden dropped out of the race, Teamsters officials had suggested to various stakeholders that the union could remain politically neutral this cycle for the first time in decades. “At the end of the day, the Teamsters are not interested if you have a ‘D,’ ‘R’ or an ‘I’ next to your name. We want to know one thing,” O’Brien said at the RNC. “What are you doing to help American workers?” An endorsement from the Teamsters, which counts members across a variety of industries and is heavily represented in critical swing states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – all of which went for Trump in 2016 before backing Biden four years later – would have been a crucial get for either candidate. Later Wednesday, the Harris campaign touted support from local Teamsters’ chapters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada, seeking to reaffirm its union support. Meanwhile, the president of the Teamsters’ National Black Caucus questioned the union’s decision to withhold an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race and suggested O’Brien was afraid to have “hard conversations” with members. “I’m not going to harp on the disappointment that my national leadership did not have the courage or the fortitude to stand up to this bully and to be able to go out and tell our entire membership, this is the best thing for you as members,” James “Curb” Curbeam, a member of Teamsters Local 480 in Nashville, said in reference to Trump. He also called into question the polling methodology used to support the union’s decision. “What is the actual number of people that took part in the polls?” Curbeam asked. Curbeam said the Black Caucus would do its own organizing in support of Harris. The Teamsters’ endorsements of Clinton and Biden in the past two presidential cycles came under previous leadership. While union members are thought of as a traditionally Democratic voting bloc, Trump has been working to make inroads among rank-and-file members. Biden had long enjoyed strong union support. He became the first sitting president to visit a picket line last September and frequently employed some version of the line, “The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class” in many of his stump speeches during his time as candidate. Harris has also begun using that line. The Teamsters internal data also revealed that a town hall straw poll taken before Biden exited the race showed him with 44% of members’ support compared with Trump’s 36%. That survey also included Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who garnered about 6% of members’ support. Kennedy has since suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump. But Harris does not have the same long history with unions and working people as the president. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is himself a former union member as a public school teacher.

Melania Trump says she stands ‘proudly behind my nude modeling work’ | CNN Politics,"Published 12:41 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T16:41:01.109Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/melania-trump-nude-modeling/index.html,"Former first lady Melania Trump posted a new video on social media Wednesday defending her previous nude modeling work as she promoted her new book. “Why do I stand proudly behind my nude modeling work? The more pressing question is: Why has the media chosen to scrutinize my celebration of the human form in a fashion photo shoot?” she said in the video posted on X. The former first lady added: “Are we no longer able to appreciate the beauty of the human body? Throughout history, master artists have revered the human shape, evoking profound emotions and admiration.” “We should honor our bodies and embrace the timeless tradition of using art as a powerful means of self expression,” she said. A spokesperson for the former first lady did not immediately respond to questions about what media scrutiny Melania Trump was referring to or whether the photographs had received recent attention. The former first lady’s forthcoming memoir, titled “Melania,” is set to hit shelves in October, according to Skyhorse Publishing. Her office, when announcing the book, described it as “a powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has carved her own path, overcome adversity and defined personal excellence.” Melania Trump’s history of nude modeling was highlighted in the 2016 campaign, when the New York Post published several nude photos – which were reportedly taken in 1995 and appeared in a now-defunct French men’s magazine – that had not previously been published online. The headline on its cover was “The Ogle Office.” At the time, Donald Trump told the newspaper that the photographs were taken for a European magazine before the two knew each other and that “pictures like this are very fashionable and common.” A 2000 British GQ cover in which the Slovenian-born Melania Trump was photographed nude on Trump’s plane also resurfaced during that campaign. A year after that photo shoot’s publication, the former first lady got legal residency in the United States, receiving a green card under the elite EB-1 program, The Washington Post reported. The former president and first lady were married in 2005. Donald Trump’s two prior marriages were also to models: Ivana Zelníčková and Marla Maples. His numerous business ventures also included a modeling agency called Trump Model Management; it was closed shortly after he took office in 2017. Melania Trump has maintained a low profile throughout her husband’s 2024 presidential campaign, making only a handful of public appearances since the former president launched his third White House bid: his campaign kickoff in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home, a brief appearance in March when she accompanied him to vote in the Florida presidential primary and her attendance at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer. In July, she released a letter following the assassination attempt on her husband at a Pennsylvania rally, thanking Secret Service agents and law enforcement officials for protecting the former president and saying that she was thinking of her “fellow Americans” in the wake of the shooting. Earlier this month, the former first lady appeared to be inching further into the political spotlight in the final few months of the 2024 presidential campaign, releasing a series of politically pointed social media videos. Trump campaign advisers and close allies have said that the former first lady is supportive of her husband and his political ambitions and that she has been focused on raising their son, Barron. They added that she is very selective in choosing her political appearances. Melania Trump has appeared infrequently at private events this year, including hosting a fundraiser for a conservative LGBTQ group, the Log Cabin Republicans, at her residence at Trump Tower in New York on July 8, as well as attending an April fundraiser alongside her husband at the home of investor John Paulson."
Analysis: Ohio Republicans are being very careful in correcting Trump and Vance | CNN Politics,"Published 10:20 AM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T14:20:13.715Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/ohio-republicans-haitian-migrants-trump-what-matters/index.html,"Haiti clearly holds a place in the heart of Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. He’s been to the country at least 25 times with his wife, he said at a press conference Monday in Springfield. He helped found a school in Haiti that bears the name of his daughter, Becky, who died decades ago in a car accident. He respects the Haitians who have come to the US legally and found work in Springfield. “They’re legal,” he said on “PBS Newshour” Tuesday night. “They want to work. In fact, they want to work overtime,” he said. Further, DeWine said the Haitians found Springfield because business owners there were having trouble finding workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. But while he is defending the Haitians legally working in Springfield with Temporary Protected Status due to violence and a humanitarian crisis after storms and an earthquake there, DeWine wants to separate them from the larger immigration and border debate fueling the Republican political argument in 2024. “The immigration issue, and the border issue, obviously, is fair game,” DeWine said in the PBS interview, and it’s a refrain he has repeated in press conferences and interviews in recent days. But that’s a different issue than what’s going on in Springfield, he said. Without specifically criticizing former President Donald Trump or Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, by name, DeWine said their insistence on spreading false rumors of animal abuse by the Haitian community is “very hurtful for these men and women who work very, very hard.” Their comments are also having an effect on the rest of the community. Ohio state troopers are in Springfield schools this week after scores of bomb threats – some coming from abroad and some from in the US – put the community on edge. When he was asked if the comments from Trump and Vance were fueling the bomb threats, DeWine deflected. “The people who are making these threats are the bad people. They’re the wrong people,” he said. There’s no indication that either Trump or Vance will stop talking about the unfounded rumors of animal abuse. “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” Vance told CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday. Vance later clarified: “I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it. I didn’t create 20,000 illegal migrants coming into Springfield.” And on this point, there seems to be an ocean of disconnect between Republican leaders in Ohio, who argue that Haitians filled a desperate need in Springfield, and Trump and Vance, who argue, as Vance did, that “thousands of residents have had their lives destroyed” by the arrival of the Haitians. Like DeWine, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue has also tried very hard to correct the record on the role Haitians are playing in Springfield. Rue chose his words very carefully during an interview Tuesday when CNN’s Boris Sanchez asked if the attention brought by Vance’s story was helpful. “It’s brought a lot of negative attention to our community,” Rue said, adding that he was doing so many interviews to make sure that people are “listening to the real and true story of Springfield.” While Rue and DeWine have both said the community has admittedly had strain on its infrastructure – everything from staffing the schools to making sure the population is protected through vaccination to getting people driver’s licenses – there is also a larger story. “We are a beautiful city. We are not a horrible city. We are not falling apart. We have strain and stress and we’re trying to figure it out, but none of this attention that has been brought upon Springfield, Ohio, is helping us,” Rue said, noting there were state troopers in his city’s schools only because of threats received in the past week. At a press conference Tuesday, Rue and DeWine discouraged Trump from making a trip to the city. DeWine said the city and state are stretched resource-wise, but that “if President Trump makes that decision to come here, he will be welcomed.” Rue put it differently, saying a visit by any presidential candidate “would be an extreme strain on our resources, so it would be fine with me if they decided not to make that stop right now.”"
2024 campaign latest: Trump holds NY rally as Harris makes appeal to Latino voters | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-18T12:01:30.266Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-assassination-attempt-harris-election-09-18-24/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was going to visit Springfield, Ohio, “in the next two weeks” after repeatedly promoting an unfounded conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants in the city eating people’s pets. “I’m going to go there in the next two weeks, I’m going to Springfield and I’m going to Aurora. You may never see me again, but that’s OK. I gotta do what I gotta do,” Trump said at a rally in Uniondale, New York, also referring to Aurora, Colorado — another city he has used to promote false claims about immigration.  Trump on Wednesday said he thought the mayor of Springfield was “a very nice person” but slammed him for not expelling the migrants, who Trump falsely claimed are undocumented. The city of Springfield says on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County — which has a population of 136,000 — and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Former President Donald Trump said during a campaign rally in New York on Wednesday that if reelected he would make Ground Zero in Manhattan a national monument.   “I am announcing tonight that as president I will officially make the Ground Zero site at the World Trade Center a national monument protected and maintained by the United States government so that hallowed ground and the memory of those who perished there will be preserved for all time, preserved forever,” Trump said during the rally in Uniondale, New York.   Trump visited Ground Zero last week for a commemoration event to mark the 23rd anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris is the best choice for workers in this election, pointing to former President Donald Trump’s recent comments to cast him as anti-labor unions. “It’s a clear-cut choice, who stands with working class people and who doesn’t,” Fain told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.” “You know, I mean Donald Trump wants to fire striking workers and Kamala Harris stands – stands out there with striking workers on the picket line.” Fain was referring to Trump remarks during an interview with Tesla CEO Elon Musk during which the former president seemingly agreed with the tactic of intimidating workers who go on strike. Following the interview, the UAW filed federal labor charges against Trump and Musk. Fain’s comments come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a union that represents truck drivers, freight workers and other workers, decided not to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in nearly 30 years. Asked by Collins whether the non-endorsement is a blow to Harris, Fain said, “Not really.” However, Trump has falsely claimed that he won the endorsement of the “rank-and-file” of Teamsters. Responding to Trump’s claim, Fain pointed to several local Teamsters chapters, including the key battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada, endorsing Harris. Emmy-award winner Liza Colón-Zayas and Grammy-award winner Anthony Ramos will appear alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, a campaign official told CNN. The appearance from the two actors marks the Harris campaign’s effort to ramp up engagement with Latino voters after the campaign announced a $3 million investment in Spanish-language radio advertising last week.  Colón-Zayas became the first Latina to win an Emmy for best supporting actress on Sunday for her role in “The Bear.” Ramos, who starred in “Hamilton” and “In the Heights,” campaigned along Vice President Kamala Harris at an event in Miami last year.  Variety first reported the two actors appearing alongside Walz. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff sharply rebuked recent comments made by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggesting Vice President Kamala Harris not having biological children robs her of something “keeping her humble.” “They said that somehow, because Cole and Ella aren’t Kamala’s quote, unquote biological children, that she doesn’t have anything in her life to keep her humble,” Emhoff told supporters at a campaign fundraiser in Brooklyn, New York. “As if keeping women humble, whether you have children or not, is something we should strive for.”  While introducing former President Trump at a town hall in Michigan, Sanders said her three children serve as a “permanent reminder of everything that is at stake in this country” that Harris “doesn’t have anything to keep her humble.” Emhoff said Wednesday that he and Harris experience the “same joys of raising children as any parent anywhere.” “There is nothing more important to me Kamala and Kerstin than our kids, our big, beautiful, blended family,” Emhoff continued, referring to his first wife Kerstin Emhoff, the mother of his children. The second gentleman also swiped at Trump while rallying women Harris supporters, who he said “will never humble themselves before Donald Trump.”  “We know what they’re really trying to do. It’s Dobbs. It’s Project 2025. It’s spreading hate and trying to pit women against each other, trying to pit us all against each other,” he said. “But I’ve got news for him. Women in this country are sick and tired of weak men trying to take away their fundamental rights and then and then gaslight you about it.”  “We’re sick and tired of it, and the women in this country will never humble themselves before Donald Trump,” he added. House Republicans sounded off after Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal to extend government funding failed and divided the GOP conference. Pressed on whether a shutdown before the election could hurt Republicans, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she thinks “this is a complete failure of the speaker’s strategy.” “Again, we weren’t here in the entire month of August and could have finished our 12 separate appropriations bills,” she said. The package tied a 6-month funding stopgap to a bill banning non-citizens from voting, known as the SAVE Act. The House voted 202 to 220, with 14 Republicans voting against it with two Republicans voting present. Three Democrats voted for the bill. Earlier Wednesday, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, encouraging lawmakers to allow the government to shut down rather than pass a funding extension without the SAVE Act included.  Asked about Trump’s post, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who voted present, said: “I think he needs to get to know Mike Johnson. There’s no way Mike Johnson’s doing that. If he think’s Mike Johnson’s doing that, Mike Johnson’s getting one over on Trump.” Rep. Marc Molinaro, a vulnerable Republican from New York who voted for the package, indicated that he would not support a shutdown. “We have to support the continuity of government,” he told reporters. New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who supported the legislation, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday evening that “the reality is we’re not shutting down the government with 48 days to go before an election.” The election is going to be decided by voters based on the issues that are impacting them, Lawler said, and a shutdown “will only distract from that and certainly won’t serve any real purpose.” This post has been updated with comments from Rep. Mike Lawler. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed he received the endorsement of the “rank-and-file” of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters despite the union declining to endorse a presidential candidate. The union announced on Wednesday that for the first time in nearly three decades it would not endorse a presidential candidate. Internal polling released by the Teamsters showed about 60% of its members believed the union should endorse Trump, while 34% supported Vice President Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign on Wednesday touted the endorsement of local Teamsters union chapters in some key battleground states. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is touting the endorsement of local Teamsters union chapters in some key battleground states after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to make an official endorsement in the presidential election on Wednesday. The campaign boasted new endorsements from local Teamsters union chapters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. Some context: The campaign is seeking to reaffirm its union support following the non-endorsement from the union’s leadership. The Teamsters union choosing to not endorse Harris marks the first time since 1996 the union has not endorsed the Democratic nominee for president. Survey data released by the union on Wednesday showed a majority of its members support former President Donald Trump. The House failed on Wednesday to pass a six-month GOP government funding plan that included a controversial measure targeting noncitizen voting, an effort pushed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The defeat of the bill puts Republican divisions on full display, but creates an opportunity for Speaker Mike Johnson to pivot to a Plan B as a shutdown looms. The House vote was 202 to 220, with 14 Republicans voting against it, two Republicans voting present and three Democrats voting for it. While Johnson has not yet said what his next steps will be, government funding runs out at the end of the month. A “clean” funding extension without the voting provisions attached is widely viewed on Capitol Hill as the only viable option to prevent a shutdown. Meanwhile, Trump is ramping up the pressure for a shutdown if Republicans are unable to pass the voting measure, which is considered a non-starter in the Democrat-led Senate. Johnson, fresh off the defeat on the House floor, told reporters he will “draw up another play” but did not specify what he will do next. Read more on the funding legislation here Vice President Kamala Harris has 50% support among likely voters to 48% for former President Donald Trump in the latest national poll from Fox News, suggesting no clear leader in the race.  Among registered voters, the survey finds Harris and Trump closely matched on who would do a better job bringing needed change (50% Harris to 47% Trump) and making the country safe (50% Trump to 47% Harris). Harris is more often seen as better able to help the middle class (53% Harris to 44% Trump), unite the country (50% Harris to 45% Trump), and fight for people like you (51% Harris to 46% Trump). Trump holds a 5-point advantage as more trusted to handle the economy (51% to 46%) and a 10-point lead on handling immigration (54% to 44%). Harris has the advantage on election integrity (52% to 45%), abortion (56% to 40%) and health care (54% to 43%). The two are even on trust to handle taxes (49% each) and guns (49% Trump to 48% Harris). And Harris is viewed slightly more favorably than Trump, with 49% holding a favorable view of the Vice President and 46% saying the same about the former president. About a third of Harris’ supporters say they back her because they dislike Trump (33%), with 42% saying they support her because they like her record and policies and 24% because they like her character. Among Trump’s supporters, the vast majority, 72%, point to his record and policies, with 19% saying they support him because they dislike Harris and just 8% that they back him because they like his character. This is the first poll from Fox to report a result among likely voters this cycle. The results among registered voters in the current survey are the same (50% Harris to 48% Trump) and are little changed from the near-even 49% Harris to 50% Trump result in the August poll from Fox. The poll was conducted September 13-16 among a random national sample of 1,102 registered voters, including 876 who are likely voters. Results for both the sample of registered voters and likely voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Iranian hackers sent unsolicited information they stole from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to people who were affiliated with Joe Biden’s campaign over the summer, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. There is no indication that Biden’s staff ever replied, the statement says. A spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said “a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails” and that the campaign has cooperated with law enforcement. The Trump campaign said in a statement that Harris and Biden “must come clean on whether they used the hacked material,” claiming it’s “further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election” to help the Democratic ticket. CNN previously reported that Iranian government-backed hackers stole internal Trump campaign documents and shared them with news organizations. The law enforcement statement Wednesday said that the hackers’ efforts to send information to US media outlets have continued. The hack is one of several efforts by the Iranian government attempting to “stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process,” the statement said. Law enforcement officials have previously said that those efforts also included an unsuccessful attempt to hack the Biden-Harris campaign.   The Iranian hackers did breach the email account of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone to target campaign staff in June, CNN has reported. US officials believe the hackers work for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Investigators believe the suspected Iranian hackers breached Stone’s account and then used that email account to try to break into the account of a senior Trump campaign official as part of a persistent effort to access campaign networks. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Kristen Holmes contributed reporting. This post has been updated with additional details. House lawmakers leading a bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempts into former President Donald Trump said Secret Service officials told them in their closed-door briefing that there did not appear to be “any obvious failures of security and protocols” at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where a second apparent assassination attempt occurred Sunday. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, the top Democrat on the panel, said that assessment is different than the apparent security failures that led to the first assassination attempt of Trump in July at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crow added that Secret Service officials told lawmakers that Trump had the “same security package” from the Secret Service while golfing on Sunday that he did when he was president. Following the Butler assassination attempt, President Joe Biden ordered the Secret Service to provide Trump and Harris with “a presidential level of security,” Crow said. A source familiar with Wednesday’s briefing confirmed that Secret Service officials detailed how Trump and Biden currently receive the same security package, with the exception of specialized assets from other agencies that are reserved only for the commander-in-chief.  Secret Service officials told lawmakers that the security model used to protect Trump on Sunday enabled agents to identify the potential shooter before he gained a clear line of sight at the former president or was able to fire any shots. That security model — which is the same provided by the Secret Service to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris — included a protective bubble that moved ahead of Trump on the golf course, sweeping the area and a “shift” that followed behind with the former President, the source said. GOP Rep. Mike Kelly, who chairs the task force, said the panel cannot go to Trump’s International Golf Club for a site visit or take any other official steps on this investigation until the House votes to formally expand the jurisdiction of his panel, which was created to focus specifically on the Butler assassination attempt. Kelly and Crow expect this formality to be handled quickly. CNN has reported that the effort to broaden its jurisdiction is in the works. The panel has already requested a full briefing with the Department of Justice and FBI by the end of this week. This post has been updated with additional reporting. Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday he doesn’t “want to ever be curtailed” by the Secret Service’s security measures following an apparent assassination attempt Sunday. While Trump added that he will “do what the Secret Service wants,” he told reporters at a campaign stop in New York City that he hopes to continue to “lead my life,” including playing golf. The apparent assassination attempt happened as Trump played golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Asked by reporters if he feels “hemmed in” by the security protocols, Trump said he does not but insisted, “I just have to lead my life, and I have to make American great again.” Former President Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance on Wednesday amped up his criticism of an immigration parole program that allows Haitian immigrants to legally live and work in Springfield, Ohio, insisting that he will still call them “illegal aliens.” CNN has previously reported, the city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Former President Donald Trump did not directly respond when asked Wednesday about Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ swipe at Vice President Kamala Harris for not having biological children. Asked if Harris not having biological children is something for which she should be attacked, Trump said during a campaign stop in New York City: “Well I just don’t know anything about it, really.” Sanders made the comment during a town hall she moderated with Trump in Flint, Michigan, on Tuesday. The governor said in introductory remarks that her children offer a “permanent reminder of everything that is at stake in this country” and said Harris not having children robs her of “humility.” “My kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble,” Sanders said. “You would think after four years of straight failure, she would know a little humility. Unfortunately, she doesn’t.” Former President Donald Trump said he is “probably” going to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he travels to the US next week. Asked by reporters during a campaign stop in New York City on Wednesday if he is going to meet with Zelensky, Trump replied, “Probably, yes.” While Trump and Zelensky spoke on the phone in July, a meeting between the two leaders would mark their first in-person interaction since Trump left the White House. The potential meeting comes amid concerns in Europe about what the Republican presidential nominee’s policy toward the Russia-Ukraine war would be if he were to win in November. Trump has repeatedly pledged to end the war though he’s offered no details on how he would do so. Zelensky is expected to attend the UN General Assembly in New York next week. Former President Donald Trump said the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ decision to withhold an endorsement in the presidential race was “a great honor,” citing the union’s history of endorsing Democratic presidential candidates in previous elections. During a campaign stop in New York City on Wednesday, Trump celebrated survey data released by Teamsters leadership indicating about 60% of the union’s members supported Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. “It’s a great honor. They’re not going to endorse the Democrats. That’s a big thing,” he said. “Democrats automatically have the Teamsters. They took a vote, and I guess I was at 60% or more, and that’s a great honor.” “But the vote of the Teamsters themselves was very high for me and the leadership,” he continued. “Sean O’Brien and the group, who are great people, they said, ‘We can’t endorse the Democrats.’ So, I think this is the first time in many decades that they haven’t endorsed Democrats.” The Teamsters last backed a Republican presidential candidate in 1988, with an endorsement of George H.W. Bush.  Trump’s comments come months after Teamsters’ union president Sean O’Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention in July. Since then, O’Brien has criticized Trump for comments he made in a virtual event with Elon Musk that O’Brien indicated were hostile to striking workers.   Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will stay on the Michigan ballot, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, rejecting his last-ditch attempt to remove his name. The ruling comes about one week after the Michigan Supreme Court similarly decided to keep Kennedy’s name on the state ballot. He filed the federal lawsuit after losing the state case. District Judge Denise Hood argued, in part, that removing Kennedy from the ballot would harm the minor party that nominated him in Michigan, which gave him a spot on the ballot in the first place. Kennedy, who ran as an independent candidate, withdrew from the race last month and threw his support behind former President Donald Trump. Mail-in voting in Michigan is scheduled to start September 26, although ballots for overseas and military voters are required to go out by Saturday. Former President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point could be a politically motivated move. Asked at a campaign stop in New York City for his reaction to the interest rate cut, Trump said it reflects either “the economy is very bad” or the Federal Reserve is “playing politics” with how it sets interest rates.  The Chairman of the National Black Caucus of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters is questioning the decision of his union’s senior leadership to withhold an endorsement of a presidential candidate this year. James Curbeam told CNN that he was disappointed Teamsters President Sean O’Brien did not stand up to former President Donald Trump, whom he described as a “bully,” and questioned the polling the union cited to defend it’s decision to not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in nearly three decades. Teamsters said internal polling showed that a majority of its members supported Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. Curbeam asked, “What is the actual number of people that took part in the polls?” and claimed that “the poll numbers are skewed.” Curbeam said the union’s Black Caucus is doing its own organizing in support of Harris. Vice President Kamala Harris said the rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is “welcome news,” adding her focus is on keeping prices down. In the first rate cut since March 2020, the half-point move paves the way for lower borrowing costs and marks a crucial milestone for the central bank’s historic inflation fight. Harris touted her economic proposal, which includes plans to cut taxes for more than 100 million working and middle-class Americans, affordable housing and the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.  Harris described her agenda as “the opposite of what Donald Trump would do as President,” before blasting him over his economic plans.  Trump camp responds: Trump’s team is slamming the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates with an election around the corner, suggesting with no evidence the central bank lowered borrowing costs by half a percentage point for political reasons. Asked about the decision’s timing relative to the election, Powell said the Fed applies no political filter to its decisions.   Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Wednesday dismissed the rate cut and blamed Harris’ policies for contributing to inflation and high housing costs. “A half a point is nothing compared to what American families have been dealing with for the last three years,” Vance said in Raleigh, later conceding, “It’s better than nothing.” This post has been updated with additional reporting. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump ramped up pressure on Republicans on Wednesday to shut down the government unless lawmakers can pass a controversial bill targeting non-citizen voting, a move that comes just hours before the House is expected to try, and fail, to pass a six-month funding plan that includes the voting legislation.  Johnson announced earlier in the week that the House will vote Wednesday on the six-month funding extension, which includes the voting measure, known as the SAVE Act. The vote is expected to begin around 7 p.m. ET. Due to Republican opposition, this legislation is expected to fail, leaving Congress in limbo as they scramble to meet the September 30 funding deadline. Some GOP hardliners attacked Johnson’s proposed extension, despite it being tied to the voting bill. Republican Rep. Cory Mills, who also plans to vote against the extension, said he has been “disappointed with the way the 118th Congress has handled this entire session.” “I think that we should have had more policy wins,” he said. “I think the American people would rather see us fight and lose than not fight at all,” Mills added. While Republican Rep. Chip Roy is backing the speaker’s proposal, and criticized his GOP colleagues who are opposing it, he warned that he will not accept Johnson stripping the ban on non-citizens voting from the package.  However, Rep. Steve Womack, a senior Republican appropriator, said he is “not a fan” of allowing a shutdown, despite Trump calling for one. Womack added he is “frustrated,” that they are in this position in the first place. “I think our job is to find a way to make government work for people, and that doesn’t include shuttering its operations,” Womack said. This post has been updated with remarks from lawmakers. The vice presidential candidates – Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz – are attending a Business Roundtable gathering in Washington, DC, on Thursday, according to two sources familiar with the plans.  The appearances will take place at the BRT’s quarterly gathering of its executive members, which has become a common forum for sitting presidents and political candidates to discuss policies like regulation, immigration, and taxes.  Instead of delivering traditional stump speeches, Vance and Walz will each be interviewed separately by one of the Business Roundtable’s member CEOs. The off the record event is meant to serve as a dialogue between the nation’s titans of business and those seeking the highest offices in government. Former President Trump appeared at the organization’s second-quarter meeting in June. A standing invitation to President Biden was transferred to Vice President Harris when she ascended to the top of the ticket, but schedules did not align for her to appear given the intensity of campaign travel. Politico first reported that Vance and Walz are addressing the Business Roundtable. The influential Teamsters union, representing 1.6 million workers and retirees, will not endorse a candidate for president in 2024, the first time the union is remaining neutral in a race in nearly three decades. Harris met with Teamsters leaders on Monday. O’Brien had a primetime speaking slot at this summer’s Republican National Convention but did not appear at the Democratic National Convention the following month.  The Teamsters, which represents truck drivers, freight workers and other workers, is the last major labor union to announce a presidential endorsement. The nation’s other major labor organizations have backed Harris. The Teamsters last backed a Republican presidential candidate in 1988, with an endorsement of George H.W. Bush. The Teamsters did not endorse a candidate in 1996, the last time they sat out a presidential election. Trump’s campaign reacts: After the announcement from the union, the Trump campaign argued the “rank-and-file” members support the former president and cited polling figures released earlier by the Teamsters showing Trump with a wide margin of support. “While the Executive Board of the Teamsters is making no formal endorsement, the vast majority of rank-and-file working men and women in this important organization want President Donald Trump back in the White House,” the Trump campaign said. This post has been updated with comments from the Trump campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Georgia on Friday to deliver remarks on women’s reproductive rights, days after a recent ProPublica report revealed at least two women in the state died after they couldn’t access legal abortions and timely medical care, the campaign confirmed to CNN. A Georgia mother died in 2022 from a treatable infection due to delays to her medical care stemming from the state’s restrictive abortion law, nonprofit news outlet ProPublica reported. Amber Nicole Thurman, 28, discovered she was pregnant with twins shortly after Georgia banned abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy. She tried to schedule a surgical abortion four hours away in North Carolina, but due to traffic, she was late to the appointment and instead had a medication abortion: two pills approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks’ gestation. ProPublica reported that Thurman experienced a rare complication from the medication. She retained some fetal tissue in her body and needed a dilation and curettage, known as a D&C, to remove it. At a hospital outside Atlanta where Thurman was transported after experiencing heavy bleeding and signs of infection, doctors waited to perform the procedure. Thurman died during surgery.  A maternal mortality review committee said there was “a good chance” that Thurman’s death was preventable if she’d had a D&C sooner, ProPublica reported.  ProPublica’s report also detailed another death that Georgia’s review committee called “preventable.” Candi Miller, a 41-year-old mother with several chronic conditions, died in 2022 after she experienced rare, treatable complications from a medication abortion. According to ProPublica, Miller’s family told a coroner she did not seek care because of laws around pregnancy and abortion. CNN has sought comment from Miller’s family. Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday slammed Donald Trump over immigration proposals in an appeal to Latino voters, warning of “mass deportations” and “massive detention camps” if the former president returns to office. A key demographic: Harris’ remarks come as she seeks to court the key demographic by drawing contrasts on the most controversial issues among voters. She outlined the “two very different visions” of the campaigns as she highlighted her policies including her “opportunity economy” agenda and health care. She railed against Trump’s stance on women’s reproductive rights, emphasizing nearly two dozen states now have restrictive abortion bans and pointed to the impact it has had on the Latino community.  “In more than 20 states, we have a Trump abortion ban, which criminalized health care providers in one state, providing prison for life…Many of these Trump abortion bans today, 40% of Latinas in America live in the state where the Trump abortion ban is,” Harris said. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in the Biden era after the White House spent the last three years grappling with Americans’ dissatisfaction with the cost of living, raising new questions about the health of the economy and the impact on voters at the ballot box. The move is fresh vindication for President Joe Biden, whose pandemic-era agenda ushered in trillions of dollars in government spending — which, when coupled with strong demand for goods, supply chain snarls and Russia’s war with Ukraine — drove inflation to a four-decade high. The half-percentage-point cut could indicate the elusive “soft landing” — experts’ favored term for raising borrowing costs to slow economic activity while avoiding severe joblessness — has been reached. Biden, who has publicly touted the Fed’s policy independence, will speak at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, on Thursday and likely tout an economy that’s come full circle in four years. But it could also suggest the economy, which is showing signs of stress, is in need of a jolt. Although most mainstream economists agree a recession is not around the corner, they also suggest the economy is not out of the woods yet. Read more about what voters are saying. This post has been updated with news of the rate cut. A set of new post-debate surveys from Quinnipiac University show Kamala Harris with a modest advantage over Donald Trump among likely voters in battleground Michigan and Pennsylvania, with no clear leader in the race in Wisconsin. With third party candidates included, Harris takes 51% to Trump’s 45% in Pennsylvania. In Michigan, she takes 50% to Trump’s 45%. In Wisconsin, Harris takes 48% to Trump’s 47%, with no clear leader between the two. The results are similar when looking at head-to-head matchups between just Harris and Trump in each state. Surveys from other outlets released in September have found either no clear leader or an edge for Harris in all three states. The Quinnipiac polls find Michigan and Pennsylvania likely voters closely divided over which candidate would do a better job handling the economy. In both states, 50% say Trump and 48% Harris. In Wisconsin, Trump has a slight edge on the issue, 51% to 47%. Likely voters in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin also give Trump an advantage over Harris on immigration: 50% to 46% in Pennsylvania, and 52% to 45% in Wisconsin. Michigan voters, however, are closely split with 49% saying Trump and 48% Harris. Majorities in all three states – 57% in Pennsylvania, 53% in Michigan and 53% in Wisconsin – trust Harris over Trump on abortion. About the polling: The Quinnipiac University polls were conducted September 12 through 16 and surveyed: Senate races in Montana and Ohio stand out as especially challenging contests this year for Democrats, defending a pair of veteran incumbents who are seeking reelection in states that former President Donald Trump won twice. Both contests rank in the top three among all Senate races in ad spending to date, and in future ad reservations. And dozens of new ads have hit the airwaves in these contests over the last week, reflecting key messaging strategies seen in top races across the country. Here’s a rundown of some of the recent activity in both races: Montana: Montana looms as one of the most challenging Senate races for Democrats, defending incumbent Sen. Jon Tester in the reliably red state with a thin Senate majority on the line, and advertising money from both parties is flooding the state. All advertisers have combined to spend more than $111 million since the primary on June 4, and Democrats have outspent Republicans by about $60.3 million to $50.7 million. Tester’s campaign leads in ad spending, having spent more than $24 million during that stretch, while a top GOP outside group, One Nation, ranks second at $14.2 million, and a pro-Tester super PAC, Last Best Place PAC, ranks third at $13.3 million. GOP nominee Tim Sheehy’s campaign has spent about $4.5 million on ad so far. Five new ads went up this week, including two today, and twelve new ads have hit Montana airwaves just since last Friday, a pace matched by few other 2024 contests. Ohio: Besides Tester, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is the only other Democratic incumbent seeking reelection in a state that Trump won twice, and his reelection contest is drawing more ad dollars than any other 2024 Senate race. Since the primary on March 19 and today, Ohio voters have seen more than $200 million worth of Senate advertising, and the parties are running about even – including campaigns and outside groups, Republicans have spent about $105.7 million, and Democrats have spent about $101.2 million. Six new ads from the Senate race have hit Ohio airwaves this week, and four more began airing over the weekend. The voting process in the November election is already starting. Mail ballots will be sent out to voters who request them in Wisconsin beginning on Thursday. Both presidential candidates have been dedicating a lot of time on the campaign trail in the battleground state — and it will likely be a “photo finish,” the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party said. Wisconsin was decided by about 20,000 votes in 2020. “I’m confident that everyone who casts a ballot will know that their ballot will be counted. The question is how many folks can we make sure cast ballots for (Kamala) Harris because Wisconsin is the land of the nail-biter,” Ben Wikler said. He said with just 48 days until Election Day, Democrats in the state are ramping up efforts to get their message out by organizing volunteer shifts, pushing for donations and calling voters on the phone. A hollowed-out state party apparatus. An off-kilter campaign by the governor. A botched redistricting plan that squeezed out incumbent House members. New York Democrats offered a wide array of excuses for their disastrous 2022 midterms, when Republicans flipped four seats outside New York City on their way to winning a narrow US House majority. Less than two months out from the 2024 general election, the state party, its campaign season allies, chastened candidates and Gov. Kathy Hochul are betting on what most describe as a revitalized political project – a series of them, in fact – to help the state deliver Democratic majority-makers, particularly from suburban districts, to the House next year. Former President Donald Trump’s Wednesday rally on Long Island, in Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito’s district, underscores the high stakes of the New York contests. D’Esposito is one of five New York GOP freshmen facing an onslaught from Democrats determined to claw back suburban voters. In 2022, he defeated Democrat Laura Gillen, flipping a district where Joe Biden would have routed Trump in 2020 under the current lines. Gillen is back for a rematch this year. Reps. Marc Molinaro and Mike Lawler in the Hudson Valley, Nick LaLota on Long Island and Brandon Williams in Central New York are the other Republicans facing tough reelection fights in what is still largely blue state that Kamala Harris is expected to win comfortably. Read the full story. With just 48 days until Election Day, former President Donald Trump is traveling to deeply blue Uniondale, New York, for his first large-scale rally since the second apparent assassination attempt on his life this weekend.   While Trump lost the Empire State by more than 20 points in both 2016 and 2020, he insists he has a “real chance of winning” New York in November.  Trump advisers described the visit as being somewhat steeped in nostalgia. The former president has long wanted to hold another large-scale rally in New York, his initial hometown, even more so after his event in the Bronx this May drew thousands of supporters.  “He’s always wanted to do a New York rally, in an arena,” one senior Trump adviser told CNN. Months ago, discussions over whether Trump would potentially host a political event at Madison Square Garden percolated within Trump’s campaign — initiated by the former president — though there were logistical problems that made doing so unfeasible. Despite the state not being a battleground, Trump’s advisers argue there’s merit to visiting Long Island, noting its large immigrant population as well as it being home to many blue-collar, working class voters and small business owners that the campaign is eager to court in the weeks leading up to November 5. New York is also home to several key US House races that could determine control of the chamber in the next Congress. Senate Minority Whip John Thune said he disagrees with former President Donald Trump’s call to reverse a cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), something that hit blue states hard and was part of a 2017 tax bill up for renewal next year. Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, said the changes to SALT were used to offset the price tag of the 2017 tax bill and will be needed for the same reason in 2025. Trump and congressional Republicans included the so-called SALT cap, which limits Americans’ ability to deduct state and local taxes on their federal returns to $10,000, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to pay for other tax cuts in the law. It largely affects higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions, but its unpopularity has led some GOP representatives in those states to call for its elimination as the party seeks to hold onto the House in this year’s election. “I’m a supporter of what we did in ’17 and would like to see it extended,” Thune said when asked about his personal position on the issue. CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed reporting to this post. Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance is attending a fundraiser in Washington, DC, on Wednesday evening with several fellow senators and lawmakers, according to an invitation obtained by CNN.  House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, along with Sens. Marco Rubio, Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, Rick Scott, John Barrasso, Tom Cotton, Marsha Blackburn, Chuck Grassley, Tommy Tuberville, Mike Lee and Bill Hagerty are listed as special guests, as well as several other senators. Other attendees: Several Republican Senate candidates are also attending including Kari Lake, Dave McCormick, Sam Brown, Rep. Jim Banks, Hung Cao and Bernie Moreno.  The Trump 47 event is hosted by the Associated Builders and Contractors, Deecy Gray, Jeff Miller and Marty Obst. House Speaker Mike Johnson would not reveal what he will do if his government funding plan fails Wednesday night and said he has spoken Donald Trump “a lot” about government funding after the former president floated a government shutdown.  Trump has said that if Republicans don’t receive “absolute assurances” on election security, they should not pass a funding extension. Asked by CNN if he would listen to Trump, Johnson said, “President Trump and I have talked a lot about this. We talked a lot about it with our colleagues who are building consensus on the plan.” “We all believe that election security is of preeminent importance right now,” Johnson said.  Johnson vowed to bring his spending bill to the floor regardless of its doomed fate as more than ten GOP members have already indicated they will not support it. “We’ll see what happens with the bill. All right, we’re on the field in the middle of the game. The quarterback’s calling the play. We’re going to run the play. I’m very confident,” the speaker said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed former President Donald Trump Wednesday for announcing he would support reversing a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, ahead of Trump’s Wednesday rally on Long Island, an area that was hit hard by the cap that the former president signed into law as part of a major tax bill in 2017. The New York Democrat warned Trump won’t go through with his pledge if he wins back the White House: “It’s comical, unserious and shows the lack of integrity that this man has. His promises carry as much weight as Monopoly money.”  “I’ve been a loud proponent of eliminating the SALT cap from the start. As long as I’m leader, I’ll do everything I can to make sure these caps expire at the end of next year,” Schumer said. Trump and congressional Republicans included the so-called SALT cap, which limits a taxpayer’s state and local tax deduction to $10,000, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to pay for other tax cuts in the law. It largely affects higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions, but its unpopularity has led some GOP representatives in those states to call for its elimination as the party seeks to hold onto the House in this year’s election. Republican Rep. Mike Waltz, a member of the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump, told CNN’s Manu Raju that he wants to hear how the Secret Service will adjust to prioritize Trump’s protection during today’s briefing. He added that they are “open” to the idea of sending additional funding to the Secret Service, but said the agency needs to make more changes to their operating procedures.  Pressed on whether future funding could be folded into this round of government funding, Waltz said that the Secret Service should focus on making internal changes, with or without new resources. “I think the changes Secret Service need to happen clearly yesterday, and so that’s what we’ll be, that’s what we’ll be looking for,” he said. “And those can shift internally. Mayorkas can shift agents; he can shift from HSI, he can shift from TSA, if he even had to. But if you’ve got lower threat protectees, then pull the agents onto your highest threat protectee, which is clearly Donald Trump.” Representatives from both Vice President Kamala Harris’ and former President Trump’s transition teams met with the White House Transition Coordinating Committee this week for the first time. The meeting was led by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients. It was not immediately clear which aides from the transition teams were present. Who is on the committee: The White House’s transition coordinating committee is comprised of several top administration officials, including the White House chief of staff, General Services Administration administrator, director of National Intelligence, director of the Office of Management and Budget and National Security adviser, among others. House Speaker Mike Johnson is keeping his members in the dark about a Plan B, as his first proposal to extend government funding is expected to fail on the House floor this evening. However, Republicans are warning that Congress must avoid a shutdown ahead of the election.  “We’re going to have a vote, see what happens, and then ultimately, obviously, if it fails, then obviously the speaker is going to have to, have to recalibrate. But bottom line is, there’s not going to be a shutdown,” GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told CNN’s Manu Raju. “We are 47 days away from an election. There’s not going to be a shutdown.”  Pressed on former President Donald Trump’s argument that they should shut down the government if they cannot tie the funding extension to a bill banning non-citizens from voting, Lawler maintained that they would avoid a shutdown.  Rep. Mark Alford of Missouri, another freshman Republican, pushed back on his colleagues that have agreed with Trump about allowing a possible shutdown, warning that a shutdown is “not a winner for the Republicans.” Haiti clearly holds a place in the heart of Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. He’s been to the country at least 25 times with his wife, he said at a news conference Monday in Springfield. He respects the Haitians who have come to the US legally and found work in Springfield. Further, DeWine said the Haitians found Springfield because business owners there were having trouble finding workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. But while he is defending the Haitians legally working in Springfield with Temporary Protected Status due to violence and a humanitarian crisis after storms and an earthquake there, DeWine wants to separate them from the larger immigration and border debate fueling the Republican political argument in 2024. “The immigration issue, and the border issue, obviously, is fair game,” DeWine said in the PBS interview, and it’s a refrain he has repeated in press conferences and interviews in recent days. And on this point, there seems to be an ocean of disconnect between Republican leaders in Ohio, who argue that Haitians filled a desperate need in Springfield, and Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who argue, as Vance did, that “thousands of residents have had their lives destroyed” by the arrival of the Haitians. Like DeWine, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue has also tried very hard to correct the record on the role Haitians are playing in Springfield. Read the full analysis piece here. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday defended his inclusion of the SAVE Act, a controversial measure that targets non-citizen voting, as part of a government funding plan and did not say what a plan B might look like to avert a shutdown. When asked about whether his Plan B would be to push a clean funding extension and work with Democrats, Johnson responded, “I don’t talk about Plan B. … I’m the quarterback on the field running the play, OK? I gotta focus on that down the field.” Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign is running digital ads in Michigan touting the vice president’s concern for Palestinian civilians, part of an intense fight to sway a key demographic in the critical battleground state. Atop the video reads, in all caps text, “VP HARRIS WILL NOT BE SILENT ABOUT HUMAN SUFFERING IN GAZA.”  Another one of the ads features more clips of Harris criticizing the deaths of Palestinian civilians. “What happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent.” They’re the first ads from the Harris campaign that have mentioned the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The ads began running this week, and disclosure data from Google shows the campaign has spent only a few hundred dollars running each spot – small numbers in a presidential campaign seeing hundreds of millions in ad spending, but still enough to precisely target key voters, and with extremely low production costs. That fight escalated last week, when a GOP-linked super PAC launched its own highly targeted digital advertising campaign also aimed at Michigan, featuring anti-semitic advertisements highlighting the Jewish faith of Harris’ husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, and touting Harris’ support for Israel. FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday that the FBI is working “around the clock” to investigate the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump on Sunday.  Where things stand in the probe: The FBI is leading the investigation into the 58-year-old man who authorities believe planning to attack the former president while he played golf at his West Palm Beach course over the weekend. The man, Ryan Wesley Routh, is facing two federal gun charges.   Wray said that the bureau’s investigation is “very much ongoing,” and stressed “we have dedicated the full force of the FBI to this investigation.” Those investigative efforts include resources like tactical support, evidence response teams and forensic scientists, he said.  The Harris campaign on Wednesday launched a new ad focused on Asian American voters in swing states as it seeks to court the key voting bloc. The ad, titled “My Mother,” features Vice President Kamala Harris’ remarks at the Democratic National Convention paying tribute to her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and immigrated to the US in 1958. “So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. Because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice,” the ad continued. The campaign believes the demographic is a key part of their winning coalition in November and plans an aggressive outreach in coming weeks, including Asian American voter engagement staff in every swing state and paid media. The campaign also unveiled a fact sheet outlining Harris’ and Gov. Tim Walz’s plans for AANPHI communities. The 60-second slot will air across an assortment of digital channels and nearly 70 different broadcast outlets. This marks the campaign’s third ad targeting Asian American communities in the last month and is part of the Harris campaign’s $370 million investment in digital and television reservations between Labor Day and Election Day. Members of the task force investigating the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump will be briefed by the US Secret Service Wednesday afternoon, according to an aide.  On Tuesday, the FBI searched the home of Ryan Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt, in Hawaii. The Harris campaign launched a new ad highlighting women’s reproductive freedoms featuring Hadley Duvall, a reproductive rights advocate and rape survivor. The ad, titled “Monster,” is narrated in first-person by Duvall, who describes becoming pregnant after her stepfather raped her at age 12 after years of sexual abuse.  “I just remember thinking I have to get out of my skin. I can’t be me right now. Like, this can’t be it. I didn’t know what to do. I was a child. I didn’t know what it meant to be pregnant, at all. But I had options,” Duvall said in the ad. On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris posted about Duvall while also blasting Trump over abortion policies.  “After a violation of their bodies, survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens to them next—all because of Trump Abortion Bans. This is immoral. Women and girls like Hadley deserve better,” Harris posted on X. The ad’s soundtrack notably includes Billie Eilish’s song, “When the Party’s Over” — a day after the pop megastar said she will be “voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy.”  Acting United States Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe has made a concerted effort to put himself front and center after Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt at former President Donald Trump’s Florida golf course, as he makes his pitch — both publicly and privately — for Congress to provide his agency with more resources. But lawmakers are still contending with whether the Secret Service is underfunded or simply mismanaged, and many have questions about what meaningful security improvements can be made 48 days before the presidential election to an organization under whose watch two apparent assassination attempts have occurred against a former president roughly 60 days apart. Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said his panel has asked the Secret Service to “get creative” in its requests for additional resources, adding that “they can’t hire new Secret Service agents to make a difference between now and the inauguration.” Murphy said that Senate appropriators have asked the agency to look at additional overtime costs as one option, and that the Secret Service has “come to us with some good ideas,” citing technology like drones. One possibility being discussed, according to sources, is to include additional funding to the government funding extension, which needs to pass by September 30. Senate appropriators and the Biden administration are in talks about how much money to add to the upcoming stopgap bill for USSS, telling CNN it could be “hundreds of millions of dollars” to plus-up their budget, or it could be language allowing the agency to spend its existing money faster. There is an uneasiness, however, about providing more money to an agency — whose budget has increased in the past decade — that has not been fully held accountable or shown that the issues that led to both apparent assassination attempts have been fixed. Read the full story. One of the best pollsters in America recently came out with its latest survey, and it’s good news for Kamala Harris. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll, conducted by Selzer & Co., found Donald Trump at 47% to the vice president’s 43% — within the margin of error — in a state the former president has twice won comfortably. (The poll was conducted last week, before Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Trump.) While the Hawkeye State is unlikely to be pivotal in November, the fact that Selzer found a close race in a state Trump has dominated could signal good things for Harris, both in terms of the accuracy of polling and for her chances in next-door Wisconsin. What makes the Selzer survey so important is that it’s been accurate in an era when other pollsters have struggled. Four years ago, it had Trump up in Iowa by 7 points days before the election, when other polls had Democrat Joe Biden in a much better position. I noted at the time that “this one poll is giving Trump backers hope and Democrats anxiety.” Democrats had good reason to worry. Not only did Trump end up winning Iowa by 8 points, he also vastly outperformed his polling in Wisconsin — nearly winning a state where he had trailed by high single-digits in pre-election polling. Trump would do significantly better in many other battleground states as well. Read the full analysis here. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week and labeled India a “very big abuser” when it comes to trade with the United States as he spoke about his vision for a reciprocal trade policy. Trump added that countries like India, Brazil and China are “at the top of their game and they use it against us.” Michigan voters were able to ask questions at the town hall, all of which teed up Trump to talk about his policy promises. When a retired nurse asked how he would bring down the price of food and groceries, Trump said, “We have to start always with energy,” pledging to bring down Americans’ energy bills by 50% within his first year if elected. “Interest rates are going to follow,” he said, adding, “actually they’re going to follow for another reason.” Trump also referenced an expected interest rate cut announcement from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday. “The economy is now not good, and interest rates, you’ll see they’ll do the rate cut and all the political stuff tomorrow, I think. And you know, will he do a half a point? Will he do a quarter of a point? But the reason is because the economy is not good. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to do it,” Trump said. Trump also acknowledged his rambling speaking style and pushed back on Vice President Kamala Harris’ jab during last week’s debate that people leave during his rallies. “You know, when she said that, well, your rallies, people leave. Honestly, nobody does. And if I saw them leaving, I’d say, and ladies and gentlemen, make America great again, now get the hell out. OK, because I don’t want people leaving,” Trump told a hockey arena full of supporters in Flint, Michigan. Last week in Philadelphia, Harris said people leave Trump’s rallies early “out of exhaustion and boredom,” which prompted Trump to defend his campaign events and then pivot to making false claims about immigrants eating pets in Ohio. Trump acknowledged to the Michigan crowd that he uses “long, sometimes very complex sentences and paragraphs,” but he said “they come all together.” Real estate investor Steve Witkoff, who was golfing with Trump, further detailed to CNN’s Kaitlin Collins a dramatic moment-by-moment recounting of seeing various teams of Secret Service agents spring into action simultaneously after shots were heard near the golf course.  One group of agents rushed to secure Trump, Witkoff said.  Witkoff said another group of agents worked to secure the perimeter around Trump to ensure there were no additional threats around the former president.  “There were two snipers who were next to me — they were probably three yards away from me, with their tripods on the ground,” Witkoff said. At times agents were laying on the ground to stabilize their weapons for a better aim at the possible shooter, he said, and also repositioned themselves inside a golf cart to try to get “a better shot” at the apparent assassin.  A final group of agents moved forward to where the suspected gunman was located “to engage with him,” Witkoff told Collins. Voters want more from Kamala Harris. But while the Democratic nominee has been clear about what she is not — Donald Trump — she is unwilling or unable to spell out a comprehensive blueprint for exactly what she would do as the 47th president. In an interview on Tuesday, the vice president mostly stuck to broad themes about her economic plan that were largely familiar from a previous big-picture policy speech and her convention address. But a candidate criticized by opponents for running on “vibes” and surfing a wave of joy refused to be pinned down on specifics and details, instead citing her values and background to attest to her sincerity. When asked how she’d alleviate the “squeeze” many Americans feel over child and elder care, she said her plan was for no family to pay more than 7% of their income on such costs. But she offered no roadmap for how she’d drive major social policy reform through what is likely to be a polarized Congress next year and didn’t say how she’d pay for it. On the Israel-Hamas war, Harris was strong on aspiration, vague on specifics and seemed to fall on both sides of the issue. It may be unrealistic to expect Harris, a member of an incumbent administration, to break with Biden over the war. And she’s got no power to stop it herself. But her hedging and repetitive soundbites in recent weeks show little evidence of new ideas. Read the full analysis. A week after President Barack Obama won reelection in November 2012, JD Vance, then a law student at Yale, wrote a scathing rebuke of the Republican Party’s stance on migrants and minorities. He criticized the Party’s stance for being “openly hostile to non-whites” and for alienating “Blacks, Latinos, (and) the youth.” Four years later, as Vance considered a career in Republican politics, he asked a former college professor to delete the article. That professor, Brad Nelson, taught Vance at Ohio State University while Vance was an undergraduate student. After Vance graduated, Nelson asked him to contribute to a blog he ran for the nonpartisan Center for World Conflict and Peace. Nelson told CNN that during the 2016 Republican primary he agreed to delete the article at Vance’s request, so that he might have an easier time getting a job in Republican politics. However, the article, titled “A Blueprint for the GOP,” remains viewable on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. More background: Vance has spread and defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio. Asked to support his claims in an interview with CNN, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening — though he didn’t provide the evidence.

First Fed rate cut since Covid | CNN Business,No Results Found,2024-09-18T11:43:32.460Z,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-09-18-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Read the takeaways here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by half a point could be politically motivated. When asked during a campaign stop in New York City for his reaction to the interest rate cut, Trump said it reflects either “the economy is very bad” or the Fed is “playing politics” with how it sets interest rates.  “I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much, assuming they’re not just playing politics. The economy would be very bad or they’re playing politics, one or the other. But it was a big cut,” Trump said.  While the timing of the cut could seem like the Fed is assisting Vice President Kamala Harris’ bid for the White House by easing the financial burdens Americans are currently shouldering right before they cast their votes, the central bank makes its decisions irrespective of the political calendar. “We never use our tools to support or oppose a political party, a politician, or any political outcome,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters in July, following the central bank’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Even Kevin Hassett, who served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers when Trump was president, said in a PBS News interview last week, “There’s been a whole bunch of bad data coming out and I think that a prudent Fed would start to risk manage by cutting rates now.” “It’s unfortunate that it’s before an election because of the appearance of partisanship,” said Hassett, who has been floated as Trump’s potential pick for Fed chair if he wins the election. He previously said it would be a “big mistake” for the Fed to cut before the election but said that he’s since changed his views on that because of the worsening economic conditions. Vice President Kamala Harris said the rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is “welcome news,” adding her focus is on keeping prices down. Harris touted her economic proposal, which includes plans to cut taxes for more than 100 million working and middle-class Americans, affordable housing and the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.  Harris described her agenda as “the opposite of what Donald Trump would do as President,” before blasting him over his economic plans.  “I know prices are still too high for many middle-class and working families, and my top priority as President will be to lower the costs of everyday needs like health care, housing, and groceries,” she said in the statement. The Federal Reserve’s half-point rate cut will result in lower interest rates on various consumer financial products and interest-bearing accounts. But don’t expect Wednesday’s single cut — or even another moderate cut or two this year — to necessarily drastically alter your financial life in every way. For borrowers, “rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “And for savers, these rate cuts won’t erase the benefit you got from rising rates in 2022 and 2023. Savers with competitive high-yielding accounts will still be way ahead of the game.” Read more here for a more specific look at how the Fed’s rate cutting will affect your credit cards, car loans, home loans, high-yield savings accounts, certificates of deposits and other financial accounts. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez don’t tend to agree on much, but both were pleased with the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates by a jumbo half point. The lower rates “helps us structurally,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN’s Haley Talbot on Capital Hill Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the Fed announced its decision. “We need to finance very large infrastructure projects, from housing to roads and bridges. This is going to help with all of that.” The rate cut, she added, “is long overdue.” Meanwhile, Johnson told Talbot, “It’s welcome news for consumers.” However, he questioned the timing of it, saying it’s “a little suspect.” “Right on the eve of an election? I don’t know. Count me as curious about it,” Johnson said. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday that the election in two months was not given any consideration in central bankers’ discussions. “We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing,” Powell said. “It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans,” he added, referring to the Fed’s Congressional mandate. Stocks ended a bumpy trading session lower as Wall Street continued to review the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision and projections about the economy. The Dow fell 103 points, or 0.3%, after jumping more than 300 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 declined 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3%. Elsewhere, gold futures reached a fresh record high before retreating to settle at $2,570.70 a troy ounce. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates by a jumbo half-point, marking its first rate cut since March 2020. While stocks initially jumped on the news, the trading session became volatile as investors worried that the large cut signals that the central bank is concerned that the US economy will weaken further. Powell said at his post-meeting press conference that he believes the labor market remains healthy, and that the Fed cut rates by half a point to stay ahead of potential further weakness. He added that the Fed is not yet satisfied with the cooldown in inflation. A risk of lowering rates is that as pressure eases off companies and consumers, inflation could rev up again. But on the other side, waiting too long to lower rates or doing so too slowly could help spur an economic downturn. The Fed said it expects the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% and remain at that level in its economic projections. Traders expect the Fed to cut rates again at its November and December policy meetings, though they are divided on the size of the cuts, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Powell said Wednesday that investors shouldn’t expect half-point cuts to be the central bank’s pace. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly. President Joe Biden said Wednesday the combination of falling inflation and interest rates amount to an “important moment” in the post-Covid economic recovery. “We just reached an important moment: Inflation and interest rates are falling while the economy remains strong,” Biden wrote on X shortly after the Federal Reserve slashed rates by half a percentage point.  “The critics said it couldn’t happen – but our policies are lowering costs and creating jobs,” Biden wrote. “I’ll speak tomorrow about what this means for Americans.” Biden is due to address the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday.  During Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference Wednesday, he spoke about two lesser-known kinds of interest rates: neutral and natural. “Neutral” and “natural” rates of interest are often used interchangeably, but they refer to the same concept. The term dates back to 1898 when Swedish economist Knut Wicksell wrote: “There is a certain rate of interest on loans which is neutral in respect to commodity prices and tends neither to raise nor to lower them.” In other words, there’s a Goldilocks interest rate out there. One that isn’t so low that it ushers in inflation, yet not so high that it tips the economy into a recession. In theory, that perfect rate exists in the real world. And it’s likely the missing puzzle piece needed for the Fed to achieve a soft landing, where inflation is tamed but a recession is avoided. But, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed out Wednesday, it’s really difficult to uncover in practice. It feels “significantly higher” than it was before the pandemic, he said. “How high is it? I just don’t think we know.” Fed officials generally agree with Powell’s assessment that the natural interest rate has risen over the last five years. And on Wednesday they raised through forecast a touch higher to 2.9% from 2.8% in June, according to new median projections included in the Fed’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections. That longer-term rate is lower than the central bank’s current target for interest rates of 4.75% to 5%. Inflation remains within striking distance of the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and although the unemployment rate has risen a good deal this year, a recession has been avoided and doesn’t appear to be brewing, either. So the Fed cutting rates today certainly sounds like officials took a victory lap. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell sought to make it abundantly clear that they didn’t. “We’re not really at 2%,” Powell said Wednesday, referring to the nation’s inflation rate. “We’re certainly not saying mission accomplished or anything like that,” he said, adding that “we’re encouraged by the progress we have made.” Last week, traders were pricing in an 86% chance the Federal Reserve would cut rates Wednesday by a quarter point. But by Monday, the majority of traders instead predicted the Fed would cut by a half point, which is what it did in the end. But it begs the question: Did Fed officials give in to market pressure? Asked if market expectations played any role in the Fed’s decision, Chair Jerome Powell gave a terse response, simply saying, “We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for the economy at that time… And that’s what we did today.” Stocks struggled to find direction Wednesday afternoon as investors mulled over Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on the labor market. The Dow lost 22 points, or 0.05%. The S&P 500 rose 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%. Former President Donald Trump said if reelected, he would try to exert direct power over the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. He later backed off from that statement. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday that the Fed will remain independent from political influence to ensure it can make the best decisions for the economy — even when they’re politically unpopular. “Democracies around the world, countries that are like the United States, have independent central banks. And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors, maybe, people in office as opposed to people who are not in office,” Powell said. “We do our work to serve all Americans. We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.” Powell said he strongly believes that independence will continue. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged Wednesday that while inflation has cooled across the economy, there’s one sector that has remained stubbornly hot: housing.   “Housing inflation is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit … It’s been slower than we expected,” he said during the Fed’s post-meeting press conference.  But he expressed confidence that the problems of high rent and home prices will come down with time. Asked about concerns that cutting rates could reignite demand and push prices higher, Powell noted the biggest problem with housing is something the Fed can’t control: the supply of available homes. “Where are we going to get the supply? This is not something the Fed can really fix, but I think as we normalize rates, you will see the … housing cycle normalized.” Stocks turned lower again Wednesday mid-afternoon, continuing the session’s volatile session as investors listened to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments about the labor market. The Dow fell 28 points, or 0.07% The S&P 500 declined 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2%. Powell stated that he believes the job market remains healthy and that the Fed’s half-point cut is a reflection of the central bank’s commitment to stay ahead of any worrying softness. But some investors have taken the large magnitude of the rate cut as a sign that the Fed is concerned about further weakening. Some pundits have expressed concern that the Fed’s decision to cut rates so close to a presidential election is equivalent to placing its thumb on the scale. But Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pooh-poohed that idea. “This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed, and it’s always the same,” Powell said at a press conference Wednesday. “We’re always going into this meeting in particular and asking what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve. … It is never about anything else Powell said politics is never discussed at Fed meetings. And it takes time for the effects of Fed rate actions to spread through the economy so a rate cut in September may not make much of a difference to the US economy by the November 5 election. “Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people,” Powell said. “We don’t put up any other filters. I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop. So we just don’t do that.” If you’re thinking the money printer at the Federal Reserve is about to start going brrrr again and borrowing costs are going to go back to the near-zero levels seen during the pandemic, you may be setting yourself up to be let down. That’s according to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said Wednesday that “my own sense is that we’re not going back to that.” But Powell didn’t rule it out entirely. “Honestly, we’ll find out,” he told reporters. Here’s how housing economists and other experts are reacting to the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates by a half percentage point and its impact on mortgage rates: Half-point rate cuts aren’t going to be the new normal, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday following the central bank’s decision to cut rates by an usually large half point. “I do not think that anyone should look at that and say, ‘This is the new pace,’” Powell said, referring to the future size of cuts the Fed may put forth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell knows that plenty of people who can influence public sentiment — investors, the press and economists — are glued to his press conference Wednesday, paying attention to every single word he says. So, when he started talking about the Fed’s focus on the unemployment rate as one reason the Fed cut rates aggressively, he followed up that statement with a reassurance that the job market is fine. “The labor market is in solid condition, and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there,” Powell said. “You can say that about the whole economy: The US economy is in good shape. It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down. The labor market is at a strong pace. We want to keep it there. That’s what we’re doing.” Powell, however, also noted that the labor market is weakening and hiring is slowing, both of which “bear watching.” His explanation: America has reached “maximum employment.” That’s economics speak for: “There aren’t many more people left to hire.” In its economic outlook, the Fed expected the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% but remain at that level. US stocks were higher but gave back some earlier gains on Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed reporters’ questions in a post-meeting press conference. The Dow rose 87 points, or 0.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7%. The Fed’s decision to cut interest rates by a half point suggests that it is worried about the state of the job market, which has showed signs of cooling in recent months. This is the first time the central bank has cut rates since the onset of the Covid pandemic in March 2020. Generally, the Federal Reserve prefers to raise or lower interest rates by no more than a quarter point at an individual meeting unless there’s reason to believe that economic conditions will change substantially in the coming months. So the decision to cut rates by a half point Wednesday, even though Fed officials have said throughout the year that they don’t foresee the economy entering a recession, was somewhat unusual. Fed Chair Jerome Powell justified Wednesday’s decision, saying in a post-meeting press conference that people should “take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind.” In other words, Fed officials likely believe the unemployment rate may have risked shooting even higher had they not taken more serious action now. For now, though, Powell said, “We’re not seeing rising layoffs and we’re not hearing that from companies.” But he warned, “that is something that’s getting ready to happen. So we’re not waiting for that.” The jumbo-sized half-point rate cute suggests the Federal Reserve is worried about rising unemployment, former Fed officials told CNN. It also shows the Fed is getting increasingly concerned about the health of the US economy. The Fed has a dual mandate: balance inflation and job creation. After aggressively raising its interest rate to combat inflation, job growth has slowed somewhat dramatically in recent months. It “sends a message we are really concerned about the employment mandate,” said Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. “The move in and of itself does leave open the question about whether the Fed knows something about labor markets that investors and the public don’t.” William English, a former member of the Fed Open Market Committee, said the decision shows the Fed is “more worried the economy is going to slow.”   “Take out a little bit of insurance,” English said. “Get ready for an economy that might slow more than you thought.” The US unemployment rate has risen substantially this year so far. At the start of the year, the unemployment rate was 3.7%. By July, it had jumped to 4.3%, the highest unemployment rate the nation has seen since fall 2021. Last month, it edged down slightly to 4.2%, but Federal Reserve officials don’t think will drop any more. Instead, they see the unemployment rate hitting 4.4% by the end of this year, according to median forecasts included in the Summary of Economic Projections, also referred to as the “dot plot,” that was released at 2pm ET. At the June meeting, officials thought the unemployment rate for this wouldn’t exceed 4%. On the other hand, officials believe there will be more progress on the inflation front compared to June. Officials predict the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, will cool to an annual rate of 2.3% this year versus the 2.6% rate they predicted in June. The Fed targets a 2% annual inflation rate, which officials believe will be achieved in 2026. Meanwhile, the Fed’s go-to gauge was 2.5% in August. The decision to cut by half a percentage point, rather than by a more standard quarter point, telegraphs to the world that central bankers feel a sense of urgency to provide the US economy with swift relief from elevated borrowing costs. The Fed has walked a fine line in taming price pressures without sacrificing America’s job market, an extremely difficult task because rate hikes function by deliberately cooling the economy. That tool wielded by the Fed is typically described as a sledgehammer, not a scalpel. Despite inflation receding, jitters remain, mostly centered around the job market’s future now, rather than the possibility of inflation getting stuck or reigniting. That’s precisely why there were blaring calls in recent days for the Fed to kick off the rate-cutting cycle with a bang. The unemployment rate ratcheted up relatively quickly over the past year, though from an unusually low point. Economists have widely said that whenever unemployment begins to rise, it tends to catch momentum and keep rising. That has put into jeopardy a possible soft landing for the US economy — a scenario in which inflation is tamed without a sharp increase in unemployment. Such an outcome has only happened once in modern history, in the mid-1990s, so the Fed is within reach of a historic achievement. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in the Biden era after the White House spent the last three years grappling with Americans’ dissatisfaction with the cost of living. The move raises new questions about the health of the economy and the impact on voters at the ballot box. But it is also fresh vindication for President Joe Biden, whose pandemic-era agenda ushered in trillions of dollars in government spending — which, when coupled with strong demand for goods, supply chain snarls and Russia’s war with Ukraine — drove inflation to a four-decade high. The Fed said the cut signals inflation is under control. But it could also suggest the economy, which is showing signs of stress, is in need of a jolt. The Fed said job creation and inflation are “in balance,” and most mainstream economists agree a recession is not around the corner. But few economists believe the US economy is not out of the woods yet. Here’s how Wall Street is reacting to the Federal Reserve’s half-point interest rate cut: The Federal Reserve faced pressure to start cutting rates in July, but did not. Some investors and economists pointed to rising unemployment and how the job market can sometimes take a turn for the worse on a dime. The central bank was still waiting for enough evidence that inflation had come under control, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said a weakening job market could speed up the timing of the first rate cut. The pace of the job market’s slowdown seems to have done the trick. But it also begs the question: Should the Fed have cut rates in July? Clearly, some investors believe the Fed is behind the curve and the decision to cut rates by half a point fueled that fire even more. It’s a tricky predicament for the Fed, and even the fact that the decision wasn’t unanimous casts even more doubt over the soundness of the Fed’s decision-making. “When will investors think the Fed is ahead of the curve and proactively exercising its ‘put’? This is the most important question because investors have been implicitly asking that — and hoping for this outcome — all summer long,” Jason Draho, head of asset allocation, CIO Americas, at UBS Financial Services, said in a recent analyst note. He added that the Fed’s commitment to extending the US economy’s expansion with so-called “insurance cuts” to prevent a recession is key for investors’ confidence. If you’re happy about the Federal Reserve’s decision to opt for a jumbo cut today, here’s something else to celebrate: Even more cuts could happen before the end of the year. That’s according to Fed officials’ median forecast for where they believe interest rates should be. Their forecast called for rates getting slashed by half a point more this year, according to the Summary of Economic Projections, also referred to as the “dot plot,” that was released at 2pm ET. The Fed has two remaining meetings this year in November, right after Election Day, and December. For 16 meetings that took place over the course of two years, each Federal Reserve official who voted on monetary policy decisions agreed on where interest rates should be. That streak of unanimity ended on Wednesday, when Fed Governor Michelle Bowman voted to cut rates by a quarter point rather than the half point cut the majority of officials voted for, which went into effect today. Bowman was the only official of the 11 that voted against the majority decision. That doesn’t mean, though, that there weren’t heated debates among the other 11 officials at the two-day monetary policy meeting this week. If there, it will likely be revealed in three weeks, when the Fed releases a summary of what was discussed during this month’s meeting. Bond yields declined Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a whopping half-point. The 2-year Treasury yield fell to 3.6%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 3.68%. Stocks climbed Wednesday midday as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by a half point. The Dow rose 303 points, or 0.7%. The S&P 500 gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.9%. The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates aggressively Wednesday, announcing the first rate cut since March 2020. The bold, but not unexpected, half-point move paves the way for lower borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to credit cards. It marks a crucial milestone for the central bank’s historic inflation fight, which kept rates at a bruising 23-year high for more than a year. Stocks gained Wednesday midday, with less than an hour to go until the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut decision. The Dow rose 60 points, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 gained 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%. The Fed is slated to make its announcement at 2 pm ET. The Federal Reserve wields a powerful tool. Its benchmark lending rate, which influences borrowing costs broadly, either puts the US economy in a chokehold when rates are high, or it stimulates economic activity whenever rates are loosened. That’s how the Fed wrangles runaway inflation or rising unemployment. And now, after years of inflation taking the spotlight, the job market’s health has come into greater focus. But with such power comes great scrutiny. An independent and apolitical agency, the Fed can nonetheless be subject to immense pressure from Wall Street, Capitol Hill and the White House. Under Fed Chair Jerome Powell, appointed in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, then re-appointed by President Joe Biden, that has also been the case. But Powell has stayed the path, emphasizing at all times that the central bank’s decisions are data dependent. “Jerome Powell’s Fed has navigated both market and political pressures rather well,” Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, global chief economist at Boston Consulting Group, told CNN. “Bashing the Fed is sort of everyone’s pastime, but nothing in the economy has broken.” Investors and lawmakers have called for the Fed to lower rates several times over the past year or so, citing impending doom in either the banking sector, the job market or housing if the Fed did not heed their demands. But the Fed never did. Its policy decisions have all been guided by economic data. In addition to the Federal Reserve’s big decision on interest rates today, major news could also be made from what’s known colloquially as the “dot plot,” which will be released at 2 pm ET, when the Fed’s announcement on interest rates also comes out. The dot plot refers to the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, a quarterly forecast on the economic outlook from all 12 regional Fed bank presidents and the seven members of the Fed’s Board of Governors. Their forecasts are anonymous and are displayed simply as a dot on a plot — hence the moniker. Among the projections Fed officials have to make about the economy for the remainder of this year, 2025, 2026 and over the longer run is where they believe interest rates should be to fulfill their mandate for price stability and maximum employment. In other words, the dot plot will reveal how many more rate cuts we could expect this year and further out in the future. But there’s a major caveat: “These projections are not a committee plan or any kind of a decision,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters in June, when Fed officials last submitted forecasts on the economic outlook. The “committee” Powell mentioned refers to the group of 12 Fed officials who vote on interest rate decisions. “As the economy evolves, assessments of the appropriate policy … will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals,” Powell added. For instance, at the end of last year, officials penciled in three cuts for this year, according to median projections from December’s SEP. But, at the June meeting, officials penciled in just one cut. The very real possibility of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve is fueling hopes that America’s sluggish housing market might soon turn a corner. Mortgage rates have doubled since 2020, contributing to one of the most unaffordable housing markets in history. While the Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, its actions affect borrowing costs throughout the economy. The most apparent effect: An interest rate cut could help ease the upward pressure on mortgage rates, making one piece of the home buying equation more affordable. That could be good news for first-time home buyers and existing homeowners who have been hesitant to put their houses up for sale in a higher interest-rate environment. However, it could also spell fiercer competition among home buyers. Mortgage rates have already begun steadily falling in anticipation of the Fed’s expected Wednesday cut. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to 6.20% last week — the lowest level since February 2023, and down significantly from last year’s peak of 7.79%. A single percentage point change in mortgage rates may not seem like a lot, but it can save home buyers hundreds of dollars in monthly payments. Consider as an example a home sold for $422,600, the median sales price of a home in the US according to the National Association of Realtors. Assuming the buyer put down a 20% deposit at closing and has a standard 30-year fixed mortgage rate, that buyer could save more than $2,600 per year on interest payments if they lock in a 6% mortgage rate compared to 7%. Read more here. While it was a steady (but grueling) journey getting inflation down from its 2022 peak of 9.1%, the bumpy first half of this year proved otherwise, vindicating the Federal Reserve’s patience. In 2022 and 2023 “inflation was coming down without any major impact to employment conditions or the US consumer,” Oscar Muñoz, chief US macro strategist at TD Securities, told CNN. After that, Fed officials likely realized that “the level of interest rates after the July rate hike last year was probably enough for inflation to lose momentum while maintaining the economy,” Muñoz said. Then came the dreaded bump that Fed Chair Jerome Powell had predicted long ago when describing inflation’s journey to the Fed’s 2% target. In January, inflation came in hotter than expected. Then it happened again, and again. By the time central bank officials gathered for their April 30-May 1 policy meeting, they had to admit in their statement that “in recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.” That rough patch is precisely why Americans have only recently begun to get some relief. Bond yields, which move in anticipation of the Fed’ decisions on rates, have come down over the past several weeks based on signs encouraging the Fed to cut rates, such as weaker-than-expected employment data and cooling inflation. That has resulted in tumbling mortgage rates, which are now down more than 1.5% from their two-decade high last fall. At the most high-stakes meeting for the Federal Reserve in years, there will be a new face at the table: Beth Hammack, president of the Cleveland Fed. And no one outside of the Fed has much of an idea as to her current views are on monetary policy. Hammack, who spent the last 30 years working at Goldman Sachs, joined the regional Fed bank last month following the retirement of its former president Loretta Mester. At every Fed meeting, 12 Fed officials vote, seven of whom are from the Fed’s board of governors. Aside from New York Fed President John Williams, the remaining votes are from an annually rotating panel of regional Fed presidents.  This year, the Cleveland Fed has held one of the 12 votes, which means Hammack will cast a vote that will determine how big a cut the Fed puts forth at her very first monetary policy meeting. And it’s not entirely out of the question that she could end up casting a tie-breaking vote for either a quarter-point cut or half-point cut. Heading into the meeting, traders were largely anticipating the latter, but a week ago the majority believed the Fed would cut by a quarter point. The recent pressure from markets may leave Fed officials torn over what to do at this meeting, which means every vote will carry even more weight. Here’s what economists, investors and analysts are saying as they wait for the Federal Reserve to announce whether it will cut interest rates by a quarter- or half-point: A key driver of the economy remains intact, despite a slowing job market. Sales at US retailers, which are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation, rose 0.1% in August from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. That was some unexpected good news about the economy’s health because economists projected retail sales to decline 0.2%. July’s big jump in retail spending was also revised even higher, according to the report. Consumer spending is a crucial metric closely watched by Wall Street and the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to slash interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. That’s because Americans’ spending accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy, so if they pull back sharply, then that would spell trouble for the country’s economic growth. America’s job market has loosened up over the past year, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2% in August, up from 3.8% a year earlier. That rapid increase sparked fears on Wall Street that the US economy could be heading for a recession. Consumer spending is heavily influenced by the state of the job market. Stocks fell Wednesday mid-morning as uncertainly loomed about whether the Federal Reserve will introduce an interest rate cut of a quarter- or half-point at the conclusion of its monetary policy meeting this afternoon. The Dow fell 55 points, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 declined 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.09%. After all the hype that’s been brewing for over a year, you might think that once the Federal Reserve finally cuts interest rates the economy will look and feel completely different. In reality, however, there’s not that much that will change at the drop of a hat. Sure, the stock market could have some big swings the second the Fed releases its interest rate decision at 2 pm ET on Wednesday and when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks a half hour later. Mortgage rates and the interest rates Americans pay on a variety of loans will quickly drop as well. But these two immediate effects are really just the tip of the iceberg. The bulk of the impact comes much later. That’s because when the Fed lowers or raises rates, it takes a while for the full effect of those moves to be felt across the economy. Nobel Prize-winning American economist Milton Friedman referred to this as “long and variable lags.” Read more here. It’s September 18 and the Federal Reserve is set to announce at 2 pm ET that it is cutting interest rates for the first time in a while. That exact situation has actually happened before. On September 18, 2007, the Fed delivered a half-point rate cut to address turmoil in the housing market. The air was also rife with uncertainty over whether the Fed would roll out a quarter-point cut or slash rates by half a point — just like right now. But, of course, the economy’s circumstances right now are a lot different than they were 17 years ago. The Fed’s September 2007 rate cut occurred a few months before the Great Recession, as new mortgages entering foreclosure began to climb and the job market also displayed concerning signs of weakness. The situation right now isn’t as dire as it was back then. America’s housing market is struggling with an acute affordability crisis, but there isn’t a subprime mortgage problem that’s threatening the country’s financial system. And yes, the job market has slowed over the past year, but job growth remains healthy and unemployment is still at historically low levels. In July and August 2007, the US economy lost jobs for the first time in four years. Stocks sky-rocketed after the Fed cut rates by half a point in September 2007, with the Dow up 2.5% and the S&P 500 rising by nearly 3%. Stocks were mixed Wednesday morning as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision. The Dow fell 53 points, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 added 0.02% and the Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.2%. Investors are divided about whether the Fed will announce a quarter- or half-point rate cut at 2 pm ET. While the central bank generally tends to telegraph its next move before its policy meetings, its signals have been less clear this time around. Investors leaned toward a quarter-point cut last week after data showed that consumer inflation slowed to its lowest rate since February 2021. But some current and former Fed officials in recent weeks have signaled that they support a half-point cut, and bets on such a move have gained traction on Wall Street. And while the US labor market remains strong historically, the Fed has warned that more cooling there could spell trouble for the economy. Traders see a 61% expectation that the Fed will ease rates by half a point, versus a 29% chance for a quarter-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Wall Street will be locked in to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 pm ET for clues about how much and how quickly the central bank expects to cut rates over the coming months. A single percentage point change in mortgage rates may not seem like a lot, but it can translate into thousands of dollars of savings per year for the average US home buyer. Mortgage rates were already falling ahead of the Federal Reserve’s expected interest rate cut. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to 6.20% last week, the lowest level since February 2023. Sean Grzebin, head of consumer originations at Chase Home Lending, told CNN he’s already seeing an uptick in home buying demand due to the recent drop in rates. “There’s been a lot more activity than we would typically see this time of year because of optimism around mortgage rates,” he said. Grzebin said that Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary will likely affect whether mortgage rates drop even further. “If the Fed comes out with a more cautious tone, then I think rates will settle in around where they are now,” he said. “If it looks like there will be more cuts than signaled so far, I think you’ll see more of an impact on mortgage rates.” While the Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, its actions affect borrowing costs throughout the economy. People who follow the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are obsessing over whether the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter point or a half point when it releases its decision at 2 pm ET on Wednesday. Generally, the Fed prefers to make interest rate moves in quarter-point increments. But when it looks like there’s an imminent threat to the economy, typically either from prices rising too quickly or the labor market cooling too much, central bankers opt for larger interest rate moves at a single meeting. A week ago, traders were convinced the Fed would cut by a quarter point. But now the majority of them are leaning toward a half point, according to fed funds futures. So if the Fed doesn’t produce what they expect, that risks disappointing markets and sparking a major selloff. The ironic thing about this is that for most Americans, the difference between a quarter-point cut versus a half-point cut at this meeting will be pretty insignificant. That’s because it could take years before the full effects of an interest rate cut are felt across the economy. And even though the interest rates you pay to borrow money will go down over time with a rate cut, it won’t necessarily drop the second the Fed cuts. In addition to the Federal Reserve announcement on Wednesday, several other central banks across the world are making rate decisions this week as inflation returns to more normal levels. The Bank of England is likely to hold rates steady Thursday after cutting borrowing costs for the first time since Covid last month. The Bank of Japan is set to announce its decision Friday. Unlike policymakers in other global economies, it has raised rates in recent months as inflation has returned to Japan’s economy following three decades of falling consumer prices. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda is expected to keep rates at 0.25%. Central bankers in Norway, Taiwan, Turkey, South Africa and Ukraine are also set to announce their latest policy moves on Thursday. The Federal Reserve’s decision is just a few hours away and there remains an unusual amount of uncertainty over what officials will do. There’s no doubt the Fed is cutting for the first time since Covid — but by how much remains up for debate. In recent days, there has been a break in favor of going big, with a 65% chance priced in to the futures market of a half-point cut. There is a 35% chance of a more typical quarter-point cut. Going with a bigger cut could hint at underlying concerns among Fed officials about the health of the economy. It’s a pivotal week for the US economy, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates for the first time since 2020. The move would mark a major milestone both for the central bank’s long fight with inflation and for Americans battling a higher cost of living for the past two years. But it’s also an expectation that is coming to fruition much later than the Fed and Wall Street expected in the beginning of the year. Fed officials and investors have long anticipated that borrowing costs would come down in 2024 — at some point — according to their economic forecasts. At the end of last year, the air was brimming with hope that the Fed would start cutting rates early in 2024, easing pressure not just for consumers, but also for businesses of all sizes hampered by higher costs. A spring rate cut seemed to be in the cards around the turn of the year, according to the futures market, and most major Wall Street banks estimated the first rate cut’s arrival sometime before the summer. But nine months in, rate cuts still haven’t happened, drenching Wall Street’s parade and leaving US consumers squeezed by elevated interest rates. All that could start to change this afternoon. Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, said Tuesday the US economy has reached “an important turning point” where the inflation surge has largely ended. The speech came just one day before the Federal Reserve is set to cut interest rates for the first time since Covid.  Formerly number two at the Fed, Brainard said lower interest rates would benefit home seekers, noting: “We need more homes, ultimately, to get to greater affordability. That will be more possible in an environment that is more supportive in terms of the market interest rates.” Wall Street remained optimistic but jittery Wednesday morning ahead of the opening bell. Futures on the S&P 500 were up just 0.1% and Nasdaq futures gained 0.2%. Dow futures were up around 0.1%. The S&P 500 and the Dow both hit new record highs this week as bets grew for a half-point cut from the Federal Reserve. But with just hours to go before the Fed’s announcement at 2 pm ET, traders remain divided over the issue of the exact size of the central bank’s rate reduction. Treasury yields moved up early Wednesday and the dollar fell. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a partnership with Zillow on Tuesday to increase access to home buying counselors just as falling interest rates could ease borrowing costs for those interested in buying a new home. As part of the collaboration, Zillow, which, according to HUD, reaches 217 million visitors a month, will display information about HUD’s housing counseling services to those shopping for a home on the site. “Every day, HUD’s counselors provide thousands of Americans with trusted advice about buying a home, avoiding foreclosure, and locating and sustaining affordable housing. But we know we can help even more people,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman in a statement on Tuesday. The announcement follows the Biden-Harris administration’s announcement in May that it would award nearly $40 million to expand HUD’s housing counseling services. Housing has become a prominent issue in the 2024 US presidential election as record-high home prices coupled with elevated mortgage rates have contributed to a home affordability crisis. “We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing,” said Vice President Kamala Harris during last week’s presidential debate. “The cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people.” The recent dip in mortgage rates has made mortgage payments more affordable than rent in nearly two dozen of the largest US cities, according to a recent Zillow analysis. New Orleans, Chicago and Pittsburgh offer the largest monthly mortgage payment savings compared to rent, assuming a buyer can afford a 20% down payment, according to the real estate company. Mortgage rates have doubled since 2020, contributing to one of the most unaffordable housing markets in history, but have been steadily falling in anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to 6.20% last week — down from this year’s peak of 7.22%, hit in May. While the Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, its actions affect borrowing costs. Nationwide, the monthly payment on a typical home purchase has fallen by more than $100 since May, according to Zillow. However, additional costs aside from monthly mortgage payments, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, should be considered before buying a home."
USSS makes pitch for more resources while Congress seeks to hold them responsible | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:54 AM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T11:00:19.814Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/secret-service-resources-congress-trump/index.html,"Acting USSS Director Ronald Rowe has made a concerted effort to put himself front and center after Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt at Donald Trump’s Florida golf course, as he makes his pitch, both publicly and privately, for Congress to provide his agency with more resources. But lawmakers are still contending with whether the Secret Service is underfunded or simply mismanaged, and many have questions about what meaningful security improvements can be made 48 days before the presidential election to an organization under whose watch two apparent assassination attempts have occurred against a former president roughly 60 days apart. Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, chair of the Senate appropriations subcommittee of DHS, said his panel has asked the Secret Service to “get creative” in its requests for additional resources, adding that “they can’t hire new Secret Service agents to make a difference between now and the inauguration.” Murphy said that Senate appropriators have asked the agency to look at additional overtime costs as one option, and that the Secret Service has “come to us with some good ideas,” citing technology like drones. One possibility being discussed, according to sources, is to include additional funding to the government funding extension, which needs to pass by September 30. Senate appropriators and the Biden administration are in talks about how much money to add to the upcoming stopgap bill for USSS, telling CNN it could be “hundreds of millions of dollars” to plus-up their budget, or it could be language allowing the agency to spend its existing money faster. There is an uneasiness, however, about providing more money to an agency, whose budget has increased in the past decade, that has not been fully held accountable or shown that the issues that led to both apparent assassination attempts have been fixed. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that discussions about funding for the agency are still ongoing, telling reporters, “We’re looking at that. I think it’s a matter of manpower allocation and we don’t just want to throw more money at a broken system.” Florida GOP Rep. Michael Waltz, a member of the bipartisan House task force investigating the apparent assassination attempts, told CNN, “You don’t get to have these type of spectacular, once in a generation failures and then say, ‘Well, I need more money.’” How Rowe navigates that tension, coupled with how he responds to the onslaught of requests from Capitol Hill, will largely define his tenure as acting director, a role he assumed less than two months ago after his former boss was forced to resign for her handling of the first Trump assassination attempt. While members of the bipartisan task force say the Secret Service has so far been relatively cooperative, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who is leading the Senate’s investigation into the first assassination attempt of Trump in July said he is “on the verge of outrage” and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told reporters that the agencies are “stonewall(ing) lawmakers” in the wake of the second apparent attempt. As conversations about allocating more funding remain ongoing, there is also an acknowledgement that the way the Secret Service communicates both internally and with external partners needs a major overhaul, with key questions still remaining unanswered. The House task force created to investigate the assassination attempt against Trump at his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a gunman was able to fire eight rounds at the former president, is working behind the scenes to expand its probe to also include Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt. The bipartisan group is working with the speaker’s office to broaden its narrow jurisdiction to include both apparent attempts, lawmakers say. And the panel has already requested a full briefing with the Department of Justice and FBI by the end of this week on top of continuing their ongoing investigation into the first assassination attempt against Trump. As lawmakers press for accountability and answers, many remain in disbelief that the nation’s top protective agency has now found itself in this position twice. “Two fails in 60 days. If the Secret Service thought there was a microscope on them before, then this obviously is going to double that,” said Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz, who serves on the task force. “Little did any of us think that while serving on a task force that no one thought would ever have to be created that we would be dealing with a second attempt 60 days later,” he added. Rowe is aware of the stakes, particularly with the looming presidential election that could determine whether he has a chance to remain in the role longer term. Rep. Madeleine Dean, who serves on the House task force, told CNN she was impressed by Rowe’s directness when he met with lawmakers on Friday and made a direct pitch for Congress to provide the agency with more resources. “I felt very impressed by his command of the issues and his candor,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said. “Being honest to say, we own this.” “He is currently running a really good PR campaign but, at the same time, whitewashing his own culpability in the problems that persist today,” a former Secret Service official familiar with the agency’s current internal dynamics told CNN. “He’s engaging in crisis manipulation,” the former Secret Service official added, noting that while Rowe has spent the last 10 years at the service in positions where he was at least in the room for strategy conversations, if not making decisions, that were negative to the service and led to the staffing challenges it currently faces. Rowe has by no means escaped the ire of congressional lawmakers, but there are already signs that the acting director is applying certain lessons from the fallout of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who was director of the Secret Service at the time of the July rally, and subsequently resigned after bipartisan blowback for failing to provide any substantive answers about what happened during a hearing on Capitol Hill. Rowe has seemingly attempted to make himself visible in the wake of Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt, deploying immediately to West Palm Beach where he met with the former president in person and met with law enforcement officials on the ground. Rowe’s first public appearance following the second incident was a press conference on Monday with law enforcement partners where he praised the response by the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners but also acknowledged the need for a “paradigm shift” at the agency. The public show of force led by Rowe stands in stark contrast to the finger-pointing that occurred in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s July 13 rally, when the Secret Service appeared to initially blame local law enforcement for the security breakdown that occurred that day. Local law enforcement partners who also addressed the media Monday reiterated that they were able to work with the Secret Service to stop the potential shooter before he fired a round at the former president – actions, they said, even earned praise from Trump himself. “The president called me last night, President Trump, he thanked me for everything that we did along with the Secret Service. He knows we work great together. And he feels safe,” Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County sheriff’s office told reporters. “That’s important because he is, and what we did yesterday proves that the system can work because the suspect didn’t even get close to getting a round off, and we apprehended him and brought them to justice,” he added. Monday’s press conference also struck a radically different tone than Cheatle’s first public appearance days after the Butler rally shooting. During an hourslong July hearing on Capitol Hill, Cheatle sat alone as House lawmakers pressed her repeatedly for details about the shooting at Trump’s Butler rally and, one by one, expressed frustration with over her refusal to provide clear answers about the security failure that day – ultimately leading to a rare bipartisan agreement that she should resign from her post. Since replacing Cheatle, Rowe has faced consistent pressure from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to address the security failures from July 13 and calls for accountability within the service itself. Rowe vowed to lawmakers on the bipartisan House task force last week that he would testify publicly at a later date. During his own testimony on Capitol Hill in July, Rowe told Senate lawmakers he visited the scene of the first assassination attempt as one of his first actions as acting director “to better understand how our protection failed” and pledged transparency as the investigation into those security failures moved forward. “Sunshine is the best disinfectant, and we intend to provide information to Congress as it carries out its oversight function,” he said at the time. At the same time, Rowe has received public support from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who on Tuesday praised the Secret Service’s response to the apparent attempted assassination of Trump over the weekend, saying the agency “did its job” and “eliminated a threat.” “I most certainly do,” Mayorkas said when asked by a reporter if he agrees with the acting Secret Service director that the agency did an “exemplary” job in protecting Trump over the weekend. Mayorkas spoke at Politico’s AI & Tech Summit in Washington, DC. While Rowe defended the Secret Service’s response to Sunday’s incident, he also reiterated his commitment to working with Congress to address the need for additional resources and the security gaps exposed by both assassination attempts. Moskowitz told CNN, “I think we have to give him time. He is coming in and cleaning up somebody else’s mess. So it’s unfair to judge him.” Waltz told CNN, “It has definitely improved since Cheatle’s resignation,” pointing to Rowe’s immediate trip to the site of the second apparent assassination attempt and promise to be forthcoming. “But where I’d say that is also mixed is we have yet to see any accountability,” Waltz added. While Rowe appears to be saying the right things in public and during closed-door briefings, it remains unclear if he has a plan to actually address the institutional problems raised by lawmakers – particularly given the looming uncertainty around the agency’s future budget. Rowe told Trump Monday that substantial security enhancements needed to be made if he wanted to continue playing golf safely at his private clubs, three people familiar with the meeting told CNN. The election outcome could result in wholesale changes atop the Secret Service’s leadership structure and Rowe is attempting to make himself as visible as possible in hopes he can remain in the job, the former Secret Service official said. The former official pointed out that Rowe positioned himself directly behind Trump and President Joe Biden at the recent 9/11 memorial in New York, a position typically occupied by the head of operations on the former president’s detail. “That is a really dangerous spot … where you’re basically in a kill zone,” the former official said. “But it’s also a position that’s close to Donald Trump and close to President Biden. He’s in every picture.” CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the titles of US Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Chris Murphy and Josh Hawley."

It comes as many companies have unveiled promotions and giveaways this year to try to win back the customers they lost due to price increases. Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. Hezbollah has vowed to respond to an Israeli attack that killed at least nine people and injured thousands across Lebanon on Tuesday when pagers belonging to members of the Iran-backed militant group exploded almost simultaneously. Footage showed shoppers and pedestrians collapsing in the street following the blasts. Israel was behind the attack, CNN has learned. The New York Times reported that Israel hid explosives inside a batch of pagers destined for Hezbollah. A switch was embedded to detonate them remotely, it added. Israel has not commented. The attack risks further escalating tensions in the Middle East already heightened over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. It also underscores Hezbollah’s vulnerability as its communication network was compromised to deadly effect. Days following an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, both presidential candidates pressed on with campaign efforts in must-win states on Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, where she denounced the false rumors about migrants in Springfield, Ohio, as “a crying shame.” Trump hosted a town hall in Flint, Michigan, and shook hands with supporters at his first campaign event since Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt. He discussed tariffs, his recent phone calls with President Joe Biden and Harris, and he said the Secret Service “did a hell of a job” on Sunday. Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to block a bill that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide. Democrats brought the bill back to the Senate floor after GOP lawmakers previously blocked the measure from advancing in June. The bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans’ health care. Many Republicans criticized the Democrat-led legislation as an unnecessary overreach while saying they do support IVF. The vote is part of a broader push by Senate Democrats to draw a contrast with Republicans over reproductive health care as the elections approach. United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain said Tuesday the union plans to hold strike authorization votes against Stellantis because the automaker is failing to live up to guarantees it made in a 2023 labor deal at the conclusion of a six-week strike. Stellantis — which makes vehicles in North America under the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands — had 43,000 UAW members nationwide at 19 manufacturing facilities at the time of last year’s strike. It is possible, since only some locals will be holding strike authorization votes, that only some plants will go on strike. But even a limited strike could affect operations at several Stellantis facilities. The automaker denied violating its contract and said it still had plenty of time to meet the agreed investment targets and vehicle production commitments. Sean “Diddy” Combs today is expected to appeal a federal judge’s decision to hold the hip-hop artist without bail after he pleaded not guilty in federal court on Tuesday to charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Until the court appearance, Combs will remain in federal detention, a judge ruled. The embattled music mogul was arrested Monday at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan and taken into custody by Homeland Security Investigations, a source familiar with negotiations for his surrender told CNN. Prosecutors allege Combs, 54, created and ran a “criminal enterprise” through his business empire that engaged in crimes including sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice, according to the federal indictment.

New York Democrats are desperate to avoid repeat of their 2022 midterm collapse | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T09:00:19.751Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/new-york-democrats-elections-trump/index.html,"A hollowed-out state party apparatus. An off-kilter campaign by the governor. A botched redistricting plan that squeezed out incumbent House members. New York Democrats offered a wide array of excuses for their disastrous 2022 midterms, when Republicans flipped four seats outside New York City on their way to winning a narrow US House majority. Now, less than two months out from the 2024 general election, the state party, its campaign season allies, chastened candidates and Gov. Kathy Hochul are betting on what most describe as a revitalized political project – a series of them, in fact – to help the state deliver Democratic majority-makers, particularly from suburban districts, to the House next year. Former President Donald Trump’s Wednesday rally on Long Island, in Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito’s district, underscores the high stakes of the New York contests. D’Esposito is one of five New York GOP freshmen facing an onslaught from Democrats determined to claw back suburban voters. In 2022, he defeated Democrat Laura Gillen, flipping a district where Joe Biden would have routed Trump in 2020 under the current lines. Gillen is back for a rematch this year. Reps. Marc Molinaro and Mike Lawler in the Hudson Valley, Nick LaLota on Long Island and Brandon Williams in Central New York are the other Republicans facing tough reelection fights in what is still largely blue state that Kamala Harris is expected to win comfortably. “New York is the reason Democrats lost the House in 2022,” said Pamela Shifman, president of the Democracy Alliance, a liberal group spending big in New York this year. “And it’s going to be the reason we win it back in 2024.” She is not alone in that analysis. In August, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi singled out New York when asked about the party’s lost majority at a Politico/CNN event at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Pressed to explain, Pelosi said, “I think it related to the gubernatorial race.” The brief but cutting remark ratcheted up the pressure on Hochul and, by extension, state party chair Jay Jacobs, the duo who have shouldered the brunt of the blame for 2022 in Democratic circles in New York and across the country. The governor has insisted that new investments and increased coordination among party leaders and the liberal grassroots will prevent a repeat in November or beyond. “We have changed this political party. We have turned it into the strength and the power that it always should have been,” Hochul told New York delegates at the Democratic convention. Democratic operatives in New York are largely divided on whether Hochul and her allies are doing enough and in the most efficient manner. But the effort is clear: For the first time in recent history, the party and its allies appear more interested in electing their own candidates in the general election than in engaging in internecine primaries. “I give them credit for being organized up and down the ballot,” said Ana María Archila, co-director of the state’s Working Families Party, which is part of the coordinated effort and no stranger to the intraparty fights of the past. Archila said the “threat of a Trump presidency and a Trumpist Congress” has been an animating factor in the effort to coordinate across the different groups. While a Trump presidency would be a defeat, she pointed out that securing a majority in the House would pave the way for Brooklyn’s own Hakeem Jeffries to be elected speaker. The new coordinated campaign has brought the state party and Hochul’s operation together with those of Jeffries, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and New York’s junior senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, who is up for reelection this year. Former Jeffries campaign manager Lizzy Weiss is the coordinated campaign director for the state party. The coordinated committee says it has nearly 40 offices spread out over swing districts across the state, dozens of staffers and more than 10,000 volunteers phone-banking and canvassing for Democratic candidates. Hochul has raised more than $22 million ahead of her next campaign in 2026, with $5.5 million going to the state party and $3 million to the coordinated campaign. Outside groups, many of them frustrated by years of infighting among officials like former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, have also stepped up their spending and fieldwork. A Jeffries-blessed group called Battleground NY, an amalgamation of labor unions and progressive outfits such as Indivisible and the state Working Families Party, has been on the ground for nearly a year. It did extensive canvassing for Democrat Tom Suozzi during his February special election victory to succeed the since-indicted Republican George Santos in a Long Island seat. “We didn’t really see a robust coordinated operation in 2022 until the last few weeks,” Battleground NY strategist Gabby Seay told CNN. “We believe that you have to talk to voters early.” Democratic sources familiar with Jeffries’ involvement said he is determined to avoid the embarrassment of 2022. “Jeffries is completely focused on New York because he has to be,” one of the sources said. “He’s been fundraising, doing campaign stops, strategizing, meeting with all the relevant entities, having regular phone calls with the delegation to strategize, connecting them with donors – he is doing it all.” Suozzi’s success earlier this year, Seay said, underscored the importance of closer engagement with voters. While Republicans focused on immigration, crime and the conflict in Gaza, Suozzi and the Democrats – without shying away from those issues – hammered the GOP over provincial concerns such as the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction, which was capped by Trump and the Republicans in their 2017 tax law. Trump, in a social media post Tuesday, wrote he would work with Democrats to “get SALT back” – a remarkable claim given his role in curtailing it but another indication of the issue’s potency in the New York suburbs. House Majority PAC, the super PAC linked to Jeffries announced in February the creation of the New York Fund – setting aside a total of $45 million for Empire State races. The fund got a recent boost from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who donated $10 million in July. In the weeks leading up to Election Day, the bulk of the spending is going toward paid media, including TV, digital and radio ads and direct mail, boosting Democratic challengers in one of the most expensive media markets in the nation. A New York-based Democratic strategist, who is not working on any of the congressional campaigns, told CNN that Hochul’s absence from the ticket this year should also bolster the party’s House candidates. “One big difference is the congressional races are being run by New York people, unlike the governor’s race (in 2022), which had people from out of state running a campaign in New York,” said the strategist, who also expressed some sympathy for Hochul, saying that the governor “understands” the task better now than two years ago, when she headed the ticket for the first time, following Cuomo’s August 2021 resignation. “She was thrown into it – baptism by fire,” the strategist said. “(There was) no coalition, and the state party was not galvanized.” The biggest test for Democrats will likely come in the 17th Congressional District, north of New York City in the state’s Hudson Valley. Lawler, the Republican incumbent who could run for governor in 2026, unseated Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the leader of House Democrats’ campaign arm, two years ago and he faces Democratic former Rep. Mondaire Jones this fall. Lawler has sought to keep Trump at arm’s length in a district the former president would have lost by 10 points in 2020. The congressman has reaffirmed his support for Trump while forgoing his divisive rhetoric. Last week, Lawler joined more than two dozen House members in a bipartisan “unity commitment” to respect the results of the 2024 presidential election. “In our country, we hash out our ideas at the ballot box and then come together to govern once all votes are counted,” Lawler said in a statement, directly appealing to the Democrats he will need to win reelection. In a potential blow to Democrats, Jones will not be on the Working Families Party ballot line this fall after breaking with New York progressives during the primary – a slip-up that could split the anti-GOP vote in November. Another potential hurdle facing Democrats in battleground districts stems from an effort by state party lawmakers to make hay on the backlash against the US Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Abortion rights are broadly popular across party lines in red and blue states. Heading into this campaign, New York Democrats set out to juice turnout across the state – to their advantage, given the party’s sizable voter registration edge – by adding a measure that would protect reproductive rights to the ballot. But the New York Equal Rights Amendment has increasingly become a source of frustration for Democrats hoping to win back suburban swing voters. The amendment, which does not actually use the term “abortion,” has been weaponized by some Republicans, who criticize its sweeping language and added protections for “gender identity” and “gender expression.” “There has been no greater attack on women’s rights and girls’ rights in the State of New York throughout any of our lifetimes than Proposition 1 in November,” former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who narrowly lost to Hochul in the 2022 governor’s race, said this spring, when he appeared alongside former college swimmer Riley Gaines, a high-profile opponent of transgender athletes participating in women’s sports. Democrats are now grumbling about both the construction of the amendment and the lack of cash for the campaign organized to promote it. The promise last year of $20 million in funding has largely fallen by the wayside. The current figure is closer to $3 million, though there is chatter of a later spending surge from party leaders. Another Democratic strategist with deep ties in New York told CNN that, for all the handwringing over 2022 and some squabbles over who might deserve credit if the party rebounds this year, the reality is as uncertain as the broader, chaotic political climate. “There’s more focus than there was the last couple cycles, both from the state party, but also obviously the national committees,” the strategist said. “Now, whether that translates or not, I think, is still an open question.”"
Trump suggests reversing his cap on state and local tax deductions | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:53 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T02:54:40.149Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/donald-trump-salt-tax/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump indicated Tuesday that he would reverse a controversial provision of his 2017 tax cut package that limited Americans’ ability to deduct state and local taxes on their federal returns. In a Truth Social post highlighting his Wednesday rally on Long Island, New York, where many residents have been affected by the cap, Trump wrote that he would “get SALT back, lower your Taxes, and so much more.” Getting rid of the SALT cap is the latest in a string of tax breaks Trump has announced in his campaign. Last week, he called for ending taxes on overtime pay, and he previously said he would eliminate taxes on tips and on Social Security benefits if he wins the presidential election. Trump and congressional Republicans included the so-called SALT cap, which limits a taxpayer’s state and local tax deduction to $10,000, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to pay for other tax cuts in the law. It largely affects higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions, but its unpopularity has led some GOP representatives in those states to call for its elimination as the party seeks to hold onto the House in this year’s election. Democratic lawmakers have also promised to jettison the cap. Asked about Trump’s reversal, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who represents New York, said Tuesday that he’s always supported eliminating the cap, which he called “a nasty piece of legislation supported by Donald Trump.” Schumer blasted Trump on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying the former president “must be suffering from selective amnesia, because he was the one who took away people’s SALT deductions in the first place. His tax bill did it – a dagger aimed at blue states that want to spend a little more to help people with housing, and health care, and education, transportation.” “All of a sudden, now that he is on Long Island, Donald Trump’s selective amnesia kicks in and he totally reverses himself on SALT,” Schumer continued. The cap, like the TCJA’s other individual tax provisions, is set to lapse at the end of 2025. Until now, Trump has repeatedly said he would fully extend the expiring measures. Raising or eliminating the cap, however, would be very expensive – which is one reason Republican leaders have resisted efforts to change it. Removing the limit would increase the cost of extending the 2017 tax cut law by $1.2 trillion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which called such a move “costly, distortionary and regressive.” Some 92% of the relief would go to the top 10% of households, while less than 1% would go to the bottom 60%. At least one Republican leader poured cold water on the idea of eliminating the SALT cap on Wednesday. Senate Minority Whip John Thune said the changes to the deduction were used to offset the price tag of the 2017 tax package and will be needed for the same reason when Congress has to address the law’s expiring provisions next year. “That was a big pay-for in 2017 and there will be a lot of, certainly, pushback from some of our members who think that subsidizing the high tax states isn’t a good idea,” Thune told reporters in the Capitol, noting that he’d like to see the cap extended."
Trump tailors his message to key state of Michigan as he returns to the campaign trail after apparent assassination attempt | CNN Politics,"Published 9:07 PM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-18T01:07:17.930Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/trump-michigan-economy/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump told a Michigan crowd Tuesday night that steep tariffs he would impose on products imported from China, Mexico and other countries would rejuvenate the state’s automotive industry and drive an economic boom. Trump, in his first campaign event since Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt, linked his economic proposals to the events at his West Palm Beach golf course on Sunday and the shooting at his Pennsylvania rally in July. “And then you wonder why I get shot at, right?” Trump said in Flint. “Only consequential presidents get shot at.” Trump said he would slap a 200% tariff on cars imported from Mexico, “which means they’re unsellable.” He also sharply criticized the United Auto Workers union president, Shawn Fain, who he said is too supportive of President Joe Biden’s efforts to transition to electric vehicles. Trump claimed those vehicles are “all going to be made in China and Mexico,” despite union contracts negotiated late last year intended to guarantee those vehicles are built in the United States. “We are going to bring so many auto plants into our country,” Trump said. “You are going to be as big or bigger than you were 50 years ago, because they won’t be able — if they’re not willing to build a plant, we don’t want their product.” Trump claimed he would impose “reciprocal” tariffs matching those other countries slap on US imports — and said tariffs are a “beautiful word.” It was a message tailored to a state that the former president won in 2016 and is rich with the kind of blue-collar voters who traditionally voted for Democrats before Trump entered the political scene. While the apparent assassination attempt on Sunday featured in his remarks frequently, Trump often sought to keep the town hall-style event focused on the auto industry and tariffs in particular. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has said Trump’s proposed tariffs would effectively amount to an inflation-driving national sales tax. Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign goods – and Harris’ campaign has noted that companies are all but certain to pass those additional costs on to consumers. The former president, meanwhile, claimed that if Harris wins on November 5, there would be “zero car jobs, manufacturing jobs — they will all be out of here.” “You won’t be making cars here anymore. You won’t be making anything in our country anymore,” Trump said. “We’re going to bring it all back.” At the Flint event, Trump’s pitch for tariffs was a key theme, but he touched on a host of other issues — including warnings of nuclear war, praise for Elon Musk, complaining about the name of the coronavirus pandemic, repeating false claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election and more. He also broke down the apparent assassination attempt, and its aftermath — including phone calls with Harris and Biden. Trump emerged from a curtain in the hockey arena that hosted the event and walked down a long pathway lined with metal barricades and flanked by security agents. People leaned out to greet him and shake his hands. Oftentimes at rallies, Trump walks onto the stage from an elevated platform and waves at supporters in the crowd without getting close. “They think race-car driving is dangerous. No, they think bull-riding — that’s pretty scary, right? No, this is a dangerous business, so we have to keep it safe,” Trump said to Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former White House press secretary who hosted the event. He recounted phone calls with Biden on Monday and Harris on Tuesday, saying both Democrats were “nice” in their conversations. Trump said he wanted to “be nice” because Biden “was so nice to me yesterday,” but he mused that he wished the calls hadn’t happened, so he didn’t have to praise his political rivals. “You know, in one way, I sort of wish the call wasn’t made, because I do feel he was so, so nice,” he said, adding, “the same with Kamala today. She couldn’t have been nicer.” Trump said the call with Harris was “very, very nice, and we appreciate that, but we have to take back our country. We have to win. We’re going to win, and we’re going to make America great again.” Harris had discussed their phone call earlier Tuesday in Philadelphia. “I checked on him to see if he is OK. I told him what I said publicly – there is no place for political violence in our country,” Harris said at a moderated conversation with the National Association of Black Journalists. “I am in this election, in this race, for many reasons, including to fight for a democracy. And in a democracy, there is no place for political violence. We can and should have healthy debates and discussions and disagreements, but not resort to violence to resolve those issues,” she said. Trump said the Secret Service “did a hell of a job, they really did,” in stopping Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination. He praised the agents who identified and stopped the would-be assassin. “Now, they do need more people, and they’ve been complaining about that for a long time. But he did a great job,” he said. His comments came amid scrutiny of the Secret Service in recent weeks — particularly over its failure to stop a shooter from firing at the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee leading the investigation into that shooting, said Tuesday he is “on the verge of outrage” with the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of cooperation. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that “the problem right now” is that the DHS and Secret Service “are refusing to give us almost any documentation.” “Why not? I mean, what do they — why don’t they want the accountability?” Hawley said. Trump also praised a witness who saw the man jump into a car and took pictures of the license plate and sent those photos to the sheriff’s office. “She saw something and decided it was bad,” he said of the witness. “Think of it — who would do this? If you took 1,000 of these incidents, would even one person have done it?”"
Economic worries boost Trump’s Hispanic support in battleground Nevada | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:20 PM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T16:04:11.321Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/nevada-hispanic-voters-trump-harris/index.html,"The sounds of blasting and bulldozing in the hills overlooking Las Vegas are proof change is a constant here, with the new $5 million homes evidence of the vibrant, upscale demand. It is progress, longtime Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez says, as she points out new construction from the patio of her own home in suburban Henderson. But it is also a reminder of a major economic and political issue here. Rents are on the rise, and starter homes are scarce. The wealthy can find what they want – or build it – but working-class families face a housing crunch. “Prices are extremely high – the highest they’ve ever been,” Sanchez said in an interview. “And with interest rates being really high, the affordability is not there for a lot of people.” Sanchez says a Federal Reserve interest rate cut would help, and she is counting on one soon not only to help her business and local families but also her candidate for president: Kamala Harris. “She’s a very smart lady,” Sanchez said of the vice president. “She talks to me. She just says everything that I need to hear.” That’s coming from a self-described Reagan Republican who hopes to one day soon vote GOP for president again. But not with Donald Trump atop the ticket. “I’ve never liked anything about him,” Sanchez said of the former president. “Nothing. The way he speaks. What he represents.  … You know, that we immigrants are the worst. That we are coming from mental institutions and jails and everything else. Which is not true.” Trump narrowly lost Nevada in both 2016 and 2020. Sanchez concedes she hears more support for him this time among Latino voters, especially men. “I want to understand it,” she said. “And I can’t. I realty can’t. … I think it is kind of a macho thing.” When we first met last December, Sanchez was ready to vote a second time for Joe Biden, mostly because of her animus toward Trump. Now, she says she is excited to vote for Harris. “If we get to elect the first women president, I mean, I just get chills to witness history,” she said. Sanchez is confident, insisting the energy she sees for Harris outweighs the increased Trump talk among fellow Hispanics. “I know that Hispanics have made a difference in a lot of elections, and I can see it right now,” Sanchez said. Rogelio Regalado and Rafael Cerros Jr. are not so sure. Close friends, Regalado and Cerros took a risk in 2020 – in the middle of the pandemic – and launched a local radio station, Fiesta 98.1. Their little startup is now No. 2 in a competitive Vegas Spanish language market. Cerros works the business side and says he is undecided in the presidential race at the moment. Regalado is the afternoon drive-time host, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, and describes himself as leaning Harris but eager to see her work harder for the Hispanic vote. “I feel the Democrats take the Hispanic vote for granted here in Vegas or in Nevada,” Cerros said. “We are one-third of the population. Last time I checked, it’s like 23% of voter registration.” The station has a weekend political show, and the campaign sometimes also comes up during the week when listeners call in to discuss music or compete for prizes. Plus the station is often represented at local events. “I see people on social media, Hispanics, sharing that post ‘I’m not with Her.’ I’m, like, wow,” Regalado said. Cerros added: “A lot of people are calling me, or calling us – Latinos, you know, talking about voting for Trump.” Both said the economy is by far the biggest reason people they know who were solid Democrats are at least open to supporting Trump. “It is 100% that,” Cerros said. Nevada was crushed during the Covid pandemic because it is so reliant on tourism. The state had the highest pandemic unemployment rate, at one point just shy of 31% – more than twice the national average. The statistics now are clear: the jobs are back, and then some. But the bruises linger, and working families trying to put the pandemic stress behind them have faced housing and inflation pressures. “We have seen the record numbers at the casinos,” Regalado said. “But some businesses are struggling still.” Cerros said Fiesta 98.1’s advertisers are mostly small, Latino-owned businesses. “A lot of small businesses are struggling,” he said. “It’s not 100% yet, to where it was. Especially with inflation.” Zena Hajji presents a different problem for Harris. Muslims are just a tiny slice of Nevada’s population, but every vote and constituency matter in a battleground settled by 33,596 votes four years ago. “A lot of Muslims are angry they are being somehow — and I would say, unfortunately — partner to the issues that are happening abroad,” Hajji said in an interview at her Henderson home. “I don’t want my tax dollars to be able to hurt people, especially when I work so hard to focus on helping people here,” Hajji said. The 21-year-old Democrat, who’s a proud daughter of Moroccan immigrants, stands with Harris on just about every issue. But the Biden administration’s support of Israel as the conflict with Hamas drags on leaves Hajji pondering a third-party vote or just skipping the presidential line on the ballot. “Why would you keep voting for a group of people that promises no more bombs, no more pain, peace in the Middle East,” Hajji said, noting that those vows haven’t held up. She said Harris is more explicit than Biden in calling for an end to the killing of Palestinian civilians, but that words are not enough. “We just need a ceasefire,” she said. “That’s it. We just need it to stop. … We are tired. We are very, very tired. And we don’t know what to do with our votes right now.” Antonio Munoz is a man of contagious optimism. A veteran, retired police officer and now the owner of the 911 Taco Bar in El Mercado, a former JC Penny department store that now houses dozens of Hispanic small businesses. When we first met last December, he was undecided in the presidential race and unhappy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump rematch. In that meeting, he bet neither Trump nor Biden would be on the ballot in the end. He was half right. Leaning Harris is where Munoz is now – intrigued and excited but also still frustrated he cannot find more specifics about her promise to help small businesses like his. “I’ve been checking her website and you read it, but it’s not specific,” Munoz said. “We do need to move forward. We need a different plan to get over the hump with this inflation that has caused severe damage to a lot of businesses. … She needs to be more direct.” A scorching summer was the latest challenge, stifling the catering business critical to Munoz’s bottom line. “We had over 30 days of 110 degrees,” Munoz said. “So we had a lot of cancellations because people didn’t want to be outside.” Now he sees a competitive election as a pause button. “Because people are afraid to go out and spend,” he said. “They don’t know what to expect when it comes around to a new administration.” Evidence of new energy for Harris begins at home for Munoz. He says his wife is excited, and that he shares her view that there is inspiration in the vice president’s story. “She came up with immigrant parents, which to me, it’s amazing for someone like that to come up and be able to be president,” Munoz said. “It’s a hit for people.” He also has no patience when Trump slams immigrants or berates the country he wants to lead. “One of the things that hurts me the most is for him to talk down America,” Munoz said. “America is a world leader. We have always been. … We’re the best. No matter who is there. The people make it the best.” But Munoz said many friends and others he encounters at community events are nostalgic for the pre-Covid economy and think that Trump is a better choice for their bottom line. Nevada also elected a Republican governor in 2022, and Munoz believes that makes it more hospitable climate for Trump this year. “He has grown,” Munoz said of the former president’s support among Hispanics. “I have friends that were Democrats who have turned the page. They feel that the country is not going in the right direction.” Harris, though, is more competitive than Biden would have been and Munoz predicts a Nevada nailbiter. “It’s a 50-50 tossup,” he said. “They need to be out here with a direct message and talking to the voters out here. I really think it is 50-50 right now. It is tight.”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week and labeled India a “very big abuser” when it comes to trade with the United States as he spoke about his vision for a reciprocal trade policy. Trump added that countries like India, Brazil and China are “at the top of their game and they use it against us.” Michigan voters were able to ask questions at the town hall, all of which teed up Trump to talk about his policy promises. When a retired nurse asked how he would bring down the price of food and groceries, Trump said, “We have to start always with energy,” pledging to bring down Americans’ energy bills by 50% within his first year if elected. “Interest rates are going to follow,” he said, adding, “actually they’re going to follow for another reason.” Trump also referenced an expected interest rate cut announcement from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday. Trump also acknowledged his rambling speaking style and pushed back on Vice President Kamala Harris’ jab during last week’s debate that people leave during his rallies. “You know, when she said that, well, your rallies, people leave. Honestly, nobody does. And if I saw them leaving, I’d say, and ladies and gentlemen, make America great again, now get the hell out. OK, because I don’t want people leaving,” Trump told a hockey arena full of supporters in Flint, Michigan. Last week in Philadelphia, Harris said people leave Trump’s rallies early “out of exhaustion and boredom,” which prompted Trump to defend his campaign events and then pivot to making false claims about immigrants eating pets in Ohio. Trump acknowledged to the Michigan crowd that he uses “long, sometimes very complex sentences and paragraphs,” but he said “they come all together.” Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, slammed JD Vance’s defense of unsubstantiated claims that Haitian immigrants are eating pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio, suggesting the Ohio senator may be “making up stories” about other topics. On Sunday, Vance fiercely defended to CNN’s Dana Bash the unfounded rumor about Haitian immigrants in the small Ohio town without providing evidence to support his claim, which has also been promoted by former President Donald Trump.   “The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” the GOP vice presidential nominee said on “State of the Union,” later adding that by “create,” he meant getting the media to focus on stories coming from constituent complaints. During a campaign rally in Asheville, North Carolina, on Tuesday, Walz jumped on Vance’s comment, claiming he “admitted” to knowingly spreading “vicious, hurtful lies about immigrants” with the intent to “spread fear” and “drum up support” for the GOP ticket.  Walz suggested Republicans are attempting to “blame the brown man” to harness fear as a “short-term motivator,” while drawing a contrast to Vice President Kamala Harris’ vision for the country.  “These guys focus on fear, fear of the unknown. Blame the brown man. Blame somebody else. That’s what they do,” Walz said. “It’s important to know who they are, but what really inspires people is policies and a vision like Kamala Harris is bringing that’s about the future.” Real estate investor Steve Witkoff on Tuesday detailed Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that they had arrived at the fifth hole on the golf course when a US Secret Service agent fired at a man who had a rifle in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. The Secret Service later said the gunman had no line of sight on the former president. Witkoff described Tuesday seeing Secret Service agents advance towards the source of the gunshots while others secured the perimeter. A group of snipers, he added, was “probably three yards away from me with their tripods on the ground.” “Everybody doing his job, and I was mesmerized by the whole thing, Kaitlan, I really was,” he said. Asked if he’d heard from Trump about whether he wants to be able to keep playing golf, Witkoff said, “I think what I would tell him is that he should do what makes him happy.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued Tuesday that the most violent rhetoric this election cycle has come from former President Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, as the two seek to blame liberals’ rhetoric for Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Trump. Ocasio-Cortez said Trump “absolutely” is a threat to democracy, citing his actions on January 6, 2021, and unwillingness to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election. The former president has argued Democrats’ insistence that he is a threat to democracy led to the two attempts on his life. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders told a crowd of Michigan voters Tuesday that her children keep her down to Earth, while remarking that Vice President Kamala Harris “doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.” Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Donald Trump’s administration, said at a town hall with the former president that the “greatest title” she has is being a mom and that her three children serve as a “permanent reminder of everything that is at stake in this country.” She told a story of how she was getting her daughter ready for a father-daughter dance and she got emotional. “My sweet daughter reaches up, pats my shoulder and says, ‘It’s OK, Mommy, one day you can be pretty too,’” she said. “So my kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble,” she continued. Some context: Harris does not have biological children, but she is stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s children from a previous marriage. The family has spoken extensively about their close relationship and how Harris has played an important role in her stepchildren’s lives. Just after being selected as Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance faced public scrutiny for previous comments he made criticizing childless adults. Democrats have continued to link the Republican ticket to the rhetoric, including Taylor Swift, who signed off on her endorsement of Harris as “childless cat lady.” Hillary Clinton slammed Elon Musk for “rotten” and “creepy” comments about Taylor Swift, saying that his reaction to the pop megastar’s endorsement of Kamala Harris was “kind of another way of saying rape, I think.”  Appearing on tech journalist Kara Swisher’s podcast, Clinton was initially asked about the potential impact of Swift’s endorsement, and the former Democratic presidential nominee was enthusiastic. “I think Taylor Swift brings an unusual impact to an endorsement. I think her fan base is so intense and incredibly influenced by her,” Clinton said. The conversation turned to Donald Trump’s critical reaction to Swift’s endorsement, and a social media post from Musk responding to the news, in which the tech billionaire wrote, “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.” Clinton said that Trump “had his alter ego, Elon Musk, say something really rotten and creepy about her.” Swisher jumped in, asking the former secretary of state to “please comment on that … what Elon said was he essentially would have a baby with her, or forcibly have a baby with her.” Clinton replied, “Yeah impregnate her, which you know, is kind of another way of saying rape, I think.” She added, “I can’t understand why he says what he says.” During the interview, released Monday, Clinton also accused critics demanding more policy details from Harris of holding her to a “double standard.” She went on to argue that Democrats needed to press a large gender gap to win in 2024, and ultimately made the case that “policy is not going to do it,” referencing her own struggles to break through to voters in 2016. Days following an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, both presidential candidates pressed on with campaign efforts in must-win states.  Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a panel in Philadelphia, while Trump hosted a town hall in Flint, Michigan, this evening.  Here are the latest developments:  Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, slammed Senate legislation that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide as a “ridiculous show vote bill” and accused Democrats of using the issue as a political weapon. Senate Republicans voted to block the measure earlier Tuesday. The bill sought to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. Vance argued the legislation “highlights one of the problems” he has with Vice President Kamala Harris’ “entire approach to government,” and criticized her and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for “ridiculous show votes so that they can win elections.” Vance reiterated his argument that the issue Republicans have with the Democrats’ bill is that it would “a huge infringement on religious liberty.”  Asked to clarify his stance on same-sex marriage, Vance said that “the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is the law of the land, and nobody is trying to change that.” “Whether you’re gay or straight, you are welcome in Donald Trump’s Republican Party so long as you believe in commonsense,” he added. Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the Secret Service “did a hell of a job” in stopping Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination in Florida. He praised the agents who identified and stopped the would-be assassin. “Now, they do need more people, and they’ve been complaining about that for a long time. But he did a great job,” he said at a town hall in Flint, Michigan.  His comments came amid scrutiny of the Secret Service in recent weeks — particularly over its failure to stop a shooter from firing at the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.  Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee leading the investigation into that shooting, said Tuesday he is “on the verge of outrage” with the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of cooperation. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said that “the problem right now” is that the DHS and Secret Service “are refusing to give us almost any documentation.” “Why not? I mean, what do they — why don’t they want the accountability?” Hawley said.  Trump also praised a witness who took pictures of the Florida suspect’s license plate and sent them to the sheriff’s office.  “She saw something and decided it was bad,” he said of the witness. “Think of it — who would do this? If you took 1,000 of these incidents, would even one person have done it?”  Former President Donald Trump recounted his calls with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris following Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on him, repeatedly saying both Democrats were “nice” to him. “I have to say that President Biden called me yesterday,” he said at a town hall in Michigan on Tuesday, calling it a “very nice conversation.” Trump said he “appreciated” that Biden called about “what happened the other day.” Trump also brought up his call earlier on Tuesday with Harris, saying that he “got a very nice call from Kamala. It was very nice.” Still, while repeating that he appreciated the calls, he told the crowd that “we have to take back our country. We have to win. We’re going to win, and we’re going to make America great again.” As Trump said his call with Harris was nice, the crowd in Flint booed, and a few people shouted “liar.”  Later, while answering a question about the auto industry and railing against the Biden administration, Trump said he wanted to “be nice” because Biden “was so nice to me yesterday,” but he mused that he wished the call hadn’t happened so he didn’t have to praise his political rivals. Donald Trump told a Michigan crowd Tuesday night that steep tariffs he would impose on products imported from China, Mexico and other countries would rejuvenate the state’s automotive industry and drive an economic boom.  The former president, in his first campaign event since Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt, said in Flint he would slap a 200% tariff on cars imported from Mexico. He said doing so would make those cars “unsellable in the United States.”  He also criticized the United Auto Workers’ president, Shawn Fain, who he said is too supportive of President Joe Biden’s efforts to transition to electric vehicles. Trump claimed those vehicles are “all going to be made in China and Mexico,” despite union contracts negotiated late last year intended to guarantee those vehicles are built in the United States.  Trump claimed he would impose “reciprocal” tariffs matching those that other countries slap on US imports — and said tariffs are a “beautiful word.”  Harris’ campaign has said Trump’s proposed tariffs would effectively amount to an inflation-driving national sales tax. Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign goods — and Harris’ campaign has noted that companies are all but certain to pass those additional costs on to consumers.  Trump linked his economic proposals to the apparent assassination attempt Sunday and one at a July rally in Pennsylvania.  Former President Donald Trump walked out through the crowd and shook hands with supporters at his first campaign event since Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against him.  Trump emerged from a curtain in a hockey arena in Flint, Michigan, and walked down a long pathway lined with metal barricades and flanked by security agents. People leaned out to greet him and shake his hands.  Oftentimes at rallies, Trump walks onto the stage from an elevated platform and waves at supporters in the crowd without getting close. “They think race-car driving is dangerous. No, they think bull-riding — that’s pretty scary, right? No, this is a dangerous business, so we have to keep it safe,” Trump remarked to Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former White House press secretary who is hosting a town hall with Michigan voters.  As she introduced Trump, Sanders said, “The left has tried everything they can think of. They’ve tried to impeach this president. They’ve tried to throw him in jail, and not once, but twice, two would-be assassins have tried to take this president down.” The crowd chanted “fight, fight, fight,” a rallying cry popularized in the wake of the assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. The Biden administration submitted a special request to congressional committees in August asking for a boost to funding for the US Secret Service in the weeks leading up to and after the 2024 election, according to sources familiar with the matter, warning of “insufficient resources” for the agency if the request isn’t granted.  The Office of Management and Budget submitted the so-called anomaly request, which includes the White House’s proposed additions to the standard contents of a short-term government funding bill, after the July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the sources told CNN.  Congress and the White House are largely expected to negotiate a deal in the coming weeks to fund the government for a period of several months, lasting at least through the election, through a package known as a continuing resolution, or “CR.”  The White House’s funding request, sources said, notes that if the change is not granted, the Secret Service would have “insufficient resources to sustain and enhance protective operations” during that period.   A detailed amount of ramped-up spending was not specified in the request, which called instead for more flexible language that allows the Department of Homeland Security to provide funding “at a rate of operations necessary to continue protective and presidential campaign operations during the CR period.”  Federal agencies customarily submit such requests to the Office of Management and Budget ahead of negotiations over short-term government funding. The language proposed by the Biden administration for enhanced Secret Service funding through the 2024 election has appeared in at least one Republican-sponsored funding bill, lending credence to the belief that such an effort would see bipartisan support on the Hill. Read more on the White House’s request here Hunter Biden asked a judge Tuesday to delay his gun sentencing from November 13 to late November or early December, in part because his family members are preoccupied with the presidential campaign and election, according to court filings. President Joe Biden’s son is set to be sentenced for three gun felonies after he was convicted on all charges at a June trial in Delaware. Separately, he pleaded guilty to nine federal tax offenses and is scheduled to be sentenced for those crimes in December in California. In all, he could face a maximum of 25 years in prison for the gun case and 17 years for the tax case, though it’s rare for people to get the most severe punishment available. Hunter Biden’s lawyers said “it will be very difficult for Mr. Biden’s counsel to be ready for sentencing on November 13,” even though his legal team has been “diligently preparing for sentencing, including working with Delaware’s Chief Probation Officer to assemble the necessary financial paperwork, arrange pre-sentencing interviews, and prepare appropriate pre-sentencing submissions.” Special counsel David Weiss opposes any delays, according to emails made public as part of Hunter Biden’s request to postpone the sentencing. Biden’s lawyers also told the judge that they want more time because some members of the Biden family, who want to write and submit supportive letters for sentencing, are busy on the campaign trial. They also raised the possibility that they might want to bring in witnesses to testify on Hunter Biden’s behalf at his gun sentencing. But they said these people “may not be available until after November 5 and the events that could occur right after that date,” referring to the presidential election. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz swiped at Georgia’s state government during a meeting with young voters in Atlanta over voting laws that he says “make it harder to vote.”  Walz met with students from four historically Black colleges and universities at a coffee shop in Atlanta on Tuesday as part of a two-state swing through Georgia and North Carolina. He said he believes Georgia should have same-day voter registration, as he has approved in Minnesota.  “We’ll compete on the field of ideas and policies, but all of these policies that make it more difficult is because they fear the voter. And they should this time, because we’re coming to vote,” he continued. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters Tuesday that lawmakers are making a few “minor” changes to a bill that would mandate that two candidates for president — Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris — receive the same level of Secret Service protection that President Joe Biden receives, and are aiming to put it on the floor this week.  Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that the safety of candidates is a bipartisan issue and that “we’re going to do everything we can.” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday welcomed presidential candidates to visit Springfield as “they have the right to be here,” but he emphasized “resources are really stretched” in the city right now. Springfield, a town of nearly 60,000 in southwestern Ohio, has been thrown into chaos since Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, began to spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets. DeWine has deployed state troopers to monitor schools in the city after they received 33 bomb threats since late last week. Local colleges have moved to remote classes due to threats. When asked whether Trump’s campaign has reached out to express support for Springfield, DeWine told reporters he hasn’t spoken with either Trump or Vance recently. Vance said Tuesday there aren’t any explicit plans for Trump or himself to visit Springfield. Vance said later Tuesday that he would like to visit the city and “talk with folks on the ground,” but said he wants to avoid overwhelming local law enforcement. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue stressed that it would be very difficult on city resources if a candidate were to visit. “It would be fine with me if they decided not to make that stop right now,” he said at the news conference with the governor. Rue also thanked DeWine for believing local leadership, adding that national leaders should “temper their words and speak truth.” This post has been updated with remarks from JD Vance. Microsoft said Tuesday that Russian operatives have in recent weeks intensified their online attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign by producing and disseminating videos promoting “outlandish conspiracy theories” aimed at stoking US racial and political divisions. One of the inauthentic videos, which Microsoft said had been viewed millions of times, claimed to show Harris supporters attacking an attendee of a Donald Trump rally. Another video falsely claimed that Harris paralyzed a young girl in a 2011 hit-and-run accident. Russian operatives promoted the latter story through a website pretending to be a San Francisco media outlet, Microsoft researchers said. Both videos were still accessible on X as of Tuesday afternoon, with one post of the video garnering 1.5 million views on its own. CNN has requested comment from the social media platform. The report is the latest evidence that Kremlin-linked trolls and digital operatives are ramping up their efforts to denigrate Harris’ campaign just weeks before the presidential election. US intelligence agencies warned in July that Russia planned to “covertly use social media” to try to sway public opinion and undermine support for Ukraine in swing states. CNN has requested comment on the Microsoft report from the Harris-Walz campaign and from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. Read more here A week after President Barack Obama won reelection in November 2012, JD Vance, then a law student at Yale, wrote a scathing rebuke of the Republican Party’s stance on migrants and minorities. He criticized the Party’s stance for being “openly hostile to non-whites” and for alienating “Blacks, Latinos, (and) the youth.” Four years later, as Vance considered a career in Republican politics, he asked a former college professor to delete the article. That professor, Brad Nelson, taught Vance at Ohio State University while Vance was an undergraduate student. After Vance graduated, Nelson asked him to contribute to a blog he ran for the nonpartisan Center for World Conflict and Peace. Nelson told CNN that during the 2016 Republican primary he agreed to delete the article at Vance’s request, so that he might have an easier time getting a job in Republican politics. However, the article, titled “A Blueprint for the GOP,” remains viewable on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. More background: Vance has spread and defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio. Asked to support his claims in an interview with CNN, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening — though he didn’t provide the evidence. Read more here  A group of GOP senators sent a letter to acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe demanding former President Donald Trump receive the same level of protection as a sitting president, after the apparent assassination attempt against him over the weekend. Sens. Tommy Tuberville, Roger Marshall, Bill Cassidy, Bill Hagerty, Mike Lee, Jim Risch, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott signed the letter, which stated: In a news conference Tuesday, several of these senators reiterated their call for greater protection for Trump. However, Marshall said the Secret Service does not need more funding. “They’ve got plenty of personnel, they’ve got plenty of money, they need to prioritize where to be placing these Secret Service agents. They’ve got the people to do it,” he said. Some background: The letter comes amid renewed scrutiny of the Secret Service and its ability to protect Trump. As CNN reported, Trump on Monday said he needed more people on his security detail and suggested he told Joe Biden that when the president called him earlier in the day.  Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, said Tuesday that the former president “ought to have the same” level of Secret Service protection as Biden. Donald Trump met with the Florida sheriff’s deputies who took the suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against him into custody, according to the Trump campaign.   Trump campaign spokeswoman Margo Martin posted a video to X on Tuesday and said, “President @realDonaldTrump meets with the Martin County Sheriff’s Office Deputies who activated the traffic stop on I-95 and took Ryan Routh into custody.” In the video, Trump is seen greeting the deputies at his Mar-a-Lago residence and says, “That’s good-looking human beings.” “Great job. Thank you very much,” Trump says as he shook the hand of every officer.  The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, was taken into custody by deputies from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office after fleeing Trump’s golf course and being detained on a nearby highway. He faces two gun-related charges. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said Donald Trump “ought to have the same” level of Secret Service protection as President Joe Biden after a second apparent assassination attempt against the former president.  Vance said he did not know whether Trump has specifically requested additional protection. However, he said he has spoken to allies on Capitol Hill who are working on appropriating funds “so that he has the security detail that maps up with President Biden’s.” As CNN reported, Trump on Monday said he needed more people on his security detail and suggested he told Joe Biden that when the president called him earlier in the day.  Vance said he has not personally requested additional Secret Service protection, saying that “I think we have what we need” and that “these guys are doing a great job.” Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told former President Donald Trump on Monday that substantial security enhancements are needed for him to continue golfing safely at his private clubs, three people familiar with the meeting told CNN.  Trump asked Rowe during the meeting at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida whether the Secret Service believed it was safe for him to continue golfing — a favorite pastime of the former president’s. Rowe said the private courses raised concerns, given the large amount of space that need to be secured and their proximity to public roads and spaces, the sources said.  A spokesperson for the Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The New York Times first reported on the exchange between Rowe and Trump.  Rowe also acknowledged that it was easier to secure the golf course at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where past presidents such as Barack Obama played while in office, given it is a military course. He also acknowledged Trump’s security detail, as a former president, is not as comprehensive as when he was in office. Some of Trump’s advisers have argued the former president should be able to continue golfing, noting it’s one of the few activities he uses to blow off steam and socialize with allies. During the meeting, Rowe also walked Trump through current security protocols as well as security enhancements that are available to his campaign, CNN previously reported. One source familiar with the meeting described it as “very direct, very matter of fact, and it was very cordial.” Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, pleaded guilty to possessing an explosive device stemming from an arrest in April 2002 in North Carolina.   According to Guilford County records, Routh was in possession of an explosive device with a 10-inch detonation cord and a blasting cap. It’s unclear what lead to Routh’s arrest. This incident is separate from another arrest in December of 2002, when Routh drove off during a traffic stop and barricaded himself inside his office. Routh has a lengthy criminal record with charges including burglary, larceny, arson and multiple charges of driving without a license.  Vice President Kamala Harris said she has full confidence in the Secret Service following Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. “I do,” Harris responded when asked whether she feels safe with her Secret Service protection. Speaking to a panel held by the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday, she then shifted her answer to address Springfield, Ohio, which has received threats after Republicans promoted false rumors about immigrants there. “But I mean, you can go back to Ohio,” Harris said. “Not everybody has Secret Service, and there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe.” “I feel safe,” Harris added. “I have Secret Service protection. But that doesn’t change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country and doing everything we can to again lift people up and not beat people down.” She said she spoke with Trump earlier today and told him there is no place for political violence in the United States The 2024 election is now less than 50 days away, and clear messaging trends are emerging in the hundreds of millions worth of campaign advertising airing across the country. Democrats are leaning into messaging focused on abortion, taxes, and health care, while Republicans are emphasizing immigration, crime, and inflation. Democrats are pouring money into campaign ads about abortion. Out of a total of $279 million spent on broadcast TV by all Democratic advertisers between August 15 and September 15, $83.8 million went to ads that referenced or discussed abortion. Democrats also spent more than $70.1 million on ads about taxes, part of a concerted effort in the presidential race to pitch middle-class tax cuts and blunt the persistent edge that voters give Trump on the economy. In addition, Democrats spent more than $52 million on ads about health care, many focused on Medicare, while ads about character, many featuring sharp personal attacks, accounted for about $36.5 million. Some Democratic advertisers have placed a greater emphasis on abortion than others. In the presidential race, the Harris campaign and its allies have focused more on economic issues, such as taxes and housing; in congressional races, meanwhile, abortion rights have been a dominant issue. Out of a total of $69.3 million spent on broadcast TV between August 15 and September 15, the Harris campaign spent $19.9 million on ads about abortion, while at the same time spending $33.9 million on ads about taxes, and $18.6 million on ads about housing. Republicans, by contrast, have almost totally avoided abortion — the main focus of Democratic attacks — in their campaign advertising, spending $0 on ads about abortion in the presidential race between August 15 and September 15, and just $6.4 million across all other races. Instead, Republicans have emphasized competing issues: immigration and crime, which are often linked in their ads, and the economy, frequently criticizing the rising cost of living and progressive tax policy. Reflecting those messaging priorities, out of a total of $275.4 million spent on broadcast TV over the last month, Republicans have spent $114 million on ads about immigration; $95.2 million on ads about crime; and $87.6 million on ads about inflation Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while speaking to Georgia Tech students in Atlanta at an event celebrating National Voter Registration Day, urged young voters there to avoid becoming cynical as they engage in politics ahead of November’s election and beyond. “It’s nothing secret to you, and you haven’t seen it — for many of us, this pessimism in our electoral system, this has not always been there. There had been joy in this, and we had a bunch of people shake hands and then they work together for a common good. This is something somewhat new, and it’s really, really scary,” he said. “My fear is that you become cynical and check out. Maybe this is where we need you to work with your friends, where they say, ‘Oh, it’s not worth it. Not worth it. Both sides are the same. I’m really not into politics,’” Walz continued. “My response to that is, too damn bad. Politics is into you.” Walz also made another reference to the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump on Sunday, again condemning the attack and calling for the end of gun violence broadly, linking the attempt on Trump’s life to the shooting at a Georgia high school earlier this month.  Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the false rumors about migrants in Springfield, Ohio, being promoted by former President Donald Trump and vice presidential nominee JD Vance, calling the rumors “a crying shame.” She added that “most people in this country, regardless of their race, are beginning to see through this nonsense,” which she said “we should not have the tolerance for.” Some background: Republicans including Vance fueled a firestorm of misinformation this month when they spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, injecting the town with chaos. The claims, which have been widely discredited, have made their way onto the national stage. Trump further pushed the false narrative during his first debate against Harris, when he falsely claimed, “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday against comments from former President Donald Trump blaming their rhetoric for a second apparent assassination attempt against him over the weekend.  In a Monday interview with Fox News, Trump blamed Biden and Harris for Sunday’s failed assassination attempt, saying, “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at.” “He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,” Trump claimed in an interview with Fox News of the suspect who came to his property in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday.  In a follow-up exchange, Jean-Pierre criticized comments from GOP vice presidential hopeful JD Vance, who said Monday that the “big difference” between conservatives and liberals is that “no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris.”  “It’s dangerous to have that type of rhetoric out there,” Jean-Pierre said. The White House press secretary also emphasized the need to “bring that temperature down of that political violent rhetoric.” A Monmouth University poll released on Tuesday finds “practically no change” in voters’ support for either of the leading presidential candidates following their debate last week. In the survey, 49% of registered voters say they will “definitely” or “probably” support Harris, while in a separate question, 44% say they will “definitely” or “probably” support Trump. In August, those numbers were 48% for Harris and 43% for Trump. These questions were not asked in the format of a horserace poll – voters could say they were likely to support both or neither — and should not be reported on as such. On the issues: Majorities of registered voters say they feel they have a good idea about the specific policies that Trump (59%) and Harris (54%) respectively would pursue to help American families if they were elected president, the poll finds. About half (52%) say they’re at least somewhat confident that the federal government would be in safe hands if Harris were president, with 48% saying the same of Trump. More about the poll: Monmouth University surveyed 803 registered voters by telephone and online on Sept. 11-15. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of +/- 3.9 percentage points. Pressed on whether her policy on the Israel-Hamas war differs from President Joe Biden’s, Vice President Kamala Harris offered no specific divergence — but said she believed it is time for a lasting ceasefire and hostage deal. Asked about a specific policy that would end the war, Harris responded, “We need to get this deal done, and we need to get it done immediately, and that is my position, and that is my policy.” More background: Harris’ answer reflected a position entirely in line with Biden’s approach to the conflict. She allowed no daylight between herself and her boss, who has unsuccessfully worked to secure an agreement that would pair a release of hostages held by Hamas with an end to the fighting in Gaza. After months of painstaking negotiations, American officials have been unable to bring the talks over the finish line. CNN reported Tuesday that Biden’s national security advisers have no imminent plans to present him with an updated proposal in the negotiations, the latest indication that talks to end the conflict have seriously stalled. Yet Harris, in her comments Tuesday, did not offer a new approach. This post has been updated with more on Harris’ comments on her Israel policy. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged she has to work to earn the vote of Black people — especially Black men. She continued: “So I’m working to earn the vote, not assuming I’m going to have it because I am Black, but because the policies and the perspectives I have.” She added she intends to be president for all Americans. Vice President Kamala Harris offered few specific plans when pressed on her plan to lower child care costs for American families. Speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday, the first question the vice president fielded was about the economy. Harris acknowledged the American dream feels “unattainable” for many young people and touted her vision for an “opportunity economy” that benefits all. One of the panelists, “Fresh Air” co-host Tonya Mosley, pressed Harris for specifics on lowering child care costs, aside from the child tax credit she has already pitched. Harris responded: “It is, sadly, the state of affairs in our country that working people often have to decide to either be able to work or be able to afford child care.” She said no family should be paying more than 7% of their income on child care, but did not say what policies she would implement to achieve that goal. Vice President Kamala Harris called former President Donald Trump this afternoon to speak with him directly to express that she is grateful that he is safe following the apparent assassination attempt against him, a White House official said.  The conversation was cordial and brief, the official said. Biden and Trump spoke yesterday: President Joe Biden and Trump had a “cordial conversation” on Monday, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons wrote on X.  Biden also conveyed his relief that Trump was safe and the former president expressed his thanks for the call, Simons said. CNN’s Sam Fossum contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris is participating in a panel discussion with members of the National Association of Black Journalists. The panel is taking place at the WHYY studios in Philadelphia. This comes several weeks after former President Donald Trump also participated in an interview with NABJ at their conference in Chicago. During that contentious interview, Trump questioned Harris’ racial identity and falsely claimed she only recently began presenting herself as Black. The FBI is currently searching the home of Ryan Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, in Hawaii. CNN can see multiple federal vehicles outside the home on the beachfront community of Kaawa on the east side of the island of Oahu. Agents are going in and out and a public information officer on site said they are executing a court-authorized search warrant. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday praised the Secret Service’s response to the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump over the weekend. The agency “did its job” and “eliminated a threat,” Mayorkas said at Politico’s AI & Tech Summit in Washington, DC. The Secret Service, which is part of DHS, has been under intense scrutiny after the second apparent assassination attempt aimed at Trump in three months, amid questions about whether the agency has the resources it needs in an elevated threat environment.  The Secret Service has “enhanced” the security posture around Trump, Mayorkas said, “so that he is receiving a level of security commensurate with the fact that he is a former president and on the campaign trail.” Mayorkas reiterated DHS’s assessment that the US is in a “heightened” threat environment that includes potential threats from foreign terrorists and domestic violent extremists.   “It is a threat environment that is of deep concern, and it requires vigilance at every level of government, and frankly on every block of each community across this country,” Mayorkas said. US officials, Mayorkas said, are also “concerned about the situation” in Springfield, Ohio, where schools were evacuated Monday after bomb threats that came in the wake of a viral and false claims about Haitian immigrants that Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, helped propagate. “The community is feeling extraordinary threatened,” Mayorkas said. “They’ve received bomb threats and other threats of violence based on false statements.” In the wake of the apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump on Sunday, the former president’s running mate, JD Vance, argued in a speech in Georgia on Monday that the two recent attempts to kill Trump are evidence that “the left needs to tone down the rhetoric and needs to cut this crap out; somebody’s going to get hurt by it.” What Vance didn’t mention was that Trump has repeatedly told the American people that his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is a fascist whose election would mean the end of the country itself. In fact, Trump called Harris a fascist at least twice last week alone. “She’s a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist,” Trump said at an Arizona rally on Thursday. “This is a radical-left, Marxist, communist, fascist,” Trump said while attacking Harris at a news conference on Friday. This wasn’t new rhetoric. “We have a fascist person running who’s incompetent,” Trump told Virginia residents during a campaign stop in August; at an Arizona rally that month, Trump said the true divide in American politics is between patriots with traditional values and “these far-left fascists led by Harris and her group.” A Vance spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNN’s request Tuesday to explain whether the Ohio senator is calling on Trump to tone down his language, and, if not, what Vance sees as the difference between Trump’s words and the words from “the left” he was denouncing. Read more of the analysis here. The Michigan Republican Party is running a radio ad supporting former President Donald Trump in Detroit featuring the city’s former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick was sent to a federal detention facility in 2013 after he was convicted on federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, extortion and filing false tax returns. Trump commuted Kilpatrick’s sentence as one of his last acts in office. The former Democratic mayor endorsed Trump earlier this summer. In the one-minute radio ad, Kilpatrick talks about how he’s had to challenge his previous beliefs, including on “identity politics.” Sen. Chris Murphy, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said his panel has asked the US Secret Service to “get creative” in its requests for additional resources, saying “they can’t hire new Secret Service agents to make a difference between now and the inauguration” in January. The Connecticut Democrat told CNN’s Manu Raju that Senate appropriators and the Biden administration are in talks about how much money to add for the Secret Service in the upcoming stop-gap government funding bill. He said it could be “hundreds of millions of dollars” to beef up the agency’s budget, or it could be language allowing the Secret Service to spend its existing money faster. Murphy said Congress doesn’t “necessarily need” to include additional Secret Service funding in the impending bill, but “we could for now give them the ability to spend at an accelerated rate between now and the inauguration.” Some background: Murphy’s comments come as the second apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump in as many months is raising new questions about whether the Secret Service can adequately protect the former president. After a second close call, President Joe Biden recognized a problem still persists. “The Secret Service needs more help,” he told reporters Monday. The sounds of blasting and bulldozing in the hills overlooking Las Vegas are proof change is a constant here, with the new $5 million homes evidence of the vibrant, upscale demand. It is progress, longtime Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez says, as she points out new construction from the patio of her own home in suburban Henderson. But it is also a reminder of a major economic and political issue here. Rents are on the rise, and starter homes are scarce. The wealthy can find what they want — or build it — but working-class families face a housing crunch. Sanchez says a Federal Reserve interest rate cut would help, and she is counting on one soon not only to help her business and local families but also her candidate for president: Kamala Harris. Donald Trump narrowly lost Nevada in both 2016 and 2020. Sanchez concedes she hears more support for him this time among Latino voters, especially men. Rogelio Regalado and Rafael Cerros Jr. both said the economy is by far the biggest reason people they know who were solid Democrats are at least open to supporting Trump. “It is 100% that,” Cerros said. Nevada was crushed during the Covid-19 pandemic because of its heavy reliance on tourism. The state had the highest pandemic unemployment rate, at one point just shy of 31% — more than twice the national average. The statistics now are clear: The jobs are back, and then some. But the bruises linger, and working families trying to put the pandemic stress behind them have faced housing and inflation pressures. Read more here Pop megastar Billie Eilish and her collaborator and brother, Finneas O’Connell, on Tuesday said they would be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris, marking the latest major celebrity endorsement for the Democratic ticket. “Today is National Voter Registration Day, and we are asking you to please join us in going to iwillvote.com to check your status and vote early like we do,” O’Connell “We can’t let extremists control our lives, our freedoms and our future. The only way to stop them and the dangerous Project 2025 agenda is to vote and elect Kamala Harris,” O’Connell said.  “Vote like your life depends on it, because it does,” Eilish said.  The pair urged supporters to cast their ballots early. “Today is National Voter Registration Day, and we are asking you to please join us in going to iwillvote.com to check your status and vote early like we do,” O’Connell said. Eilish is the latest pop artist to endorse Harris, after Taylor Swift announced last week she is supporting the vice president, ending months of speculation over whether the superstar would share her views ahead of the election. Vice President Kamala Harris again condemned political violence during her first radio interview following former President Donald Trump’s second apparent assassination attempt.  Harris made the remarks during an interview taped on Monday with Nueva Network’s radio host Stephanie Himonidis, also known as “Chiquibaby.” Harris previously said she was “deeply disturbed” and condemned violence on Sunday following the security incident that occurred while Trump was golfing in Florida. What Trump has said: The former president on Monday unleashed a series of attacks, blaming Harris and Biden for this latest apparent attempt on his life. He told Fox News Digital on Monday, that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.” He similarly lambasted the Democratic president and vice president on his Truth Social website. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and Senate allies used the chamber’s expected vote on a bill to guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide to draw contrasts between their Republican rivals, former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Vance will spend Tuesday campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin as the Senate is expected to vote on the bill. Senate Democrats are bringing the bill back to the floor after Republicans blocked the measure from advancing in June. The legislation is likely to again be blocked by GOP senators. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, one of the legislation’s sponsors, said “we know exactly how (Vance) would vote, because he voted against this bill just a couple of months ago.” Duckworth, who had her own children using IVF, said Trump and Vance “spent weeks lying about their records on IVF, and pretending to champion this cause, but we know time and again, when given the chance, they’ll never actually do anything to support IVF.” Trump’s stance: The former president is due to campaign in Michigan on Tuesday evening. The last time he was in the battleground state, he pledged to implement a policy as president that would pay for IVF, without specifying how the treatments would be paid for. He has said multiple times that his administration would be “great” for women’s reproductive rights, despite regularly touting his role in eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion that had been upheld for nearly half a century.  During the second presidential debate, Trump would not directly say whether he would veto a national abortion ban, though he has said his position is that the issue should be decided by states. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday again threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, whom he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election, if he wins the presidency. Trump posted the same message, word for word, on September 7 on Truth Social. It falsely claims Democrats engaged in fraudulent behavior in 2020 and says that Trump, attorneys and legal scholars are “watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely.” Some background: Trump has been ramping up efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election and has routinely suggested he would weaponize the justice system to go after his political opponents if voters return him to the White House — threats that began after he was first indicted in his Manhattan hush money case more than a year ago. Despite Trump’s repeated claims, the 2020 election was highly secure, and he lost to Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes. There is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome of the election in any state. Trump still faces his own charges over election interference stemming from efforts to subvert the 2020 election, including a four-count indictment in his federal case. A separate election interference case against him in Fulton County, Georgia, has been indefinitely paused. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana argued that former President Donald Trump should steer clear of debunked rumors of migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, as threats against local officials and others in the city continue.  “I think the better attack on the broken immigration system is the women who’ve been raped and murdered. We know that’s true,” said Graham. “We know that the leading cause of death for young people is fentanyl poisoning coming through a broken border coming through Mexico. I’d rather talk about that.”  He added, “I don’t know about dogs and cats, but I know about raped women. I know about people who are dying from fentanyl poisoning directly related to Mexican drug cartels who are running amok to the southern border.” Cassidy said of the rumor: “it turns out it’s not true,” and when pressed on whether Trump should continue to repeat it, he replied, “I prefer not to say things which are not true.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz visited a soul food restaurant in Macon, Georgia, where he met with voters and made brief remarks amid his two-state swing through Georgia and North Carolina on Tuesday. Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, walked into the restaurant by joking about “the perks of being on this ticket,” referring to making stops at local restaurants like H&H restaurant, a historic comfort food diner in Macon. At one instance, he spoke about the aftermath of his son Gus’ emotional reaction to seeing him speak at the Democratic National Convention last month. He told one voter, “It’s like the whole country kind of wrapped their arms around him.” “It’s scary, and it was scary. We’ve been really protective over the years,” he said. “There’s a few people that nothing is off limits, but the majority … my faith in humanity, was so restored, they wrapped their arms around that kid.” At the end of the event, Walz was introduced for brief formal remarks by Stanley Stewart, a Macon city commissioner, who spoke about Walz’s place in the legacy of Democratic politicians and mentioned meeting Vice President Kamala Harris in Selma, Alabama earlier this year.  Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged Tuesday that the law enforcement community will “work together to tirelessly determine accountability” in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump last weekend.   He continued: “The entire Justice Department — including in particular, the FBI, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, the National Security Division — are all coordinating closely with our local state law enforcement partners on the ground. We will all work together to tirelessly determine accountability in this matter. We will spare no resource in this investigation.”   Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Sunday’s incident, was charged on Monday with two gun-related crimes. Additional charges could be brought as the investigation continues, law enforcement officials have told CNN. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee leading the investigation into the first assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, said he is “on the verge of outrage” with the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of cooperation.  Blumenthal added that they have refused to provide “documents, witnesses, other evidence that is important,” and said he is open to issuing subpoenas if this continues.  “I know how to do subpoenas. I’m very willing and able to use the subpoena process, if necessary, to get information from the Department of Homeland Security, and we have told them repeatedly about our frustration,” he said. “I’m deeply dissatisfied and disappointed.”   GOP Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana declared that the Secret Service should not receive more funding until they answer Congress’ questions. “We need answers more than the Secret Service needs money,” he insisted. Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, acknowledged that the Secret Service might need more resources, but he noted that they haven’t asked for any extra funding. “I’m wide open, as I think everyone is, to the notion that the Secret Service will need more resources,” he said. “I don’t see that case being presented, but of course, if there’s more resources needed, Congress needs to act.”  Republican Sen. Josh Hawley voiced frustrations with the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service, saying the agencies are again “stonewall(ing)” the committee investigating the first assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.  The Missouri senator pointed to the lack of cooperation when asked if the committee would also be investigating Sunday’s assassination attempt, saying “the problem right now” is that the DHS and Secret Service “are refusing to give us almost any documentation.” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee leading the investigation into the first assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, also said he is “on the verge of outrage” with the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of cooperation.  Former President Donald Trump’s meeting with acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe on Monday was brief and matter of fact, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. Rowe walked the former president through their current security protocols as well as security enhancements that are available to his campaign.  CNN previously reported that Trump is expected to maintain his campaign schedule in the aftermath of the apparent second assassination attempt, on Sunday. The advisers told CNN security enhancements are being made in response to the incident, and such measures will likely be noticeable on the ground during his political events this week. The advisers would not go into detail over what exactly those enhancements will look like, citing the heightened concerns over the former president’s security. Trump and his advisers continue to praise the former president’s Secret Service personnel on the ground, with the former president having privately remarked that his day-to-day secret service detail, which he has worked with for years and knows personally, as “heroes.” “On a systematic level, there’s obviously some things that need to be changed and adjusted. That’s what we’ve always said. It’s not the people on the ground, it’s the system in place” that might not be well-equipped to handle the current environment, one of the advisers said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called for the end of gun violence in the wake of a shooting at a Georgia high school earlier this month while speaking to volunteers at a Georgia field office on Tuesday. Walz told supporters in Macon, Georgia that Vice President Kamala Harris would work to reduce mass shooting incidents in his first trip to the state since the Apalachee High School shooting in Winder, Georgia, that left four people dead and nine others injured.  Walz also made a reference to a comment Ohio Sen. JD Vance made in the aftermath of the shooting lamenting that school shootings are “a fact of life.” He also made reference to the two apparent assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump in calling for the end of gun violence. “That is not just a fact of life people, that is not just a fact of life,” he said. “And as Donald Trump would know, this violence across the country has got to end. Gun violence has got to end.” President Joe Biden said “everything is frightening” in the wake of the second apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, telling a radio show that more resources should be provided to the US Secret Service. Biden described the climate as “up across the board” in an interview airing Tuesday with the Dallas-based radio show DeDe in the Morning. Biden, who called into the show Monday night, said “just got off the phone” with Trump. “We had about a five-minute call and I told him what we’re doing,” Biden said. “He thanked me very much for the call, told me he really appreciates what I was doing, etcetera.” Biden also extolled his “smart as hell” Vice President Kamala Harris, describing their “close” work together in the interview. “We work really closely together,” Biden told the outlet. “Every major initiative that we’ve been credited for from cyber security, stuff we’ve done.” Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced an executive order to launch a state investigation into the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday at his West Palm Beach golf course. DeSantis said the Office of Statewide Prosecution would lead the investigation since there appear to be potential law violations in multiple counties. The state may be able to file stronger charges against suspect Ryan Wesley Routh than federal prosecutors, he said. “The state of Florida has jurisdiction over the most serious, straightforward offense, which is attempted murder,” DeSantis said. DeSantis waded into political territory during the news conference, saying he has doubts about the ability of federal law enforcement to be fair while investigating the threat to Trump. “In my judgment, it’s not in the best interest of our state or our nation to have the same federal agencies that are seeking to prosecute Donald Trump leading this investigation,” the governor said. The state investigation will be supervised by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, who also suggested that criticism of Trump is contributing to the threats against him. DeSantis said the investigation will not only be focused on pursuing charges against Routh, but also answering more questions about the case. “This guy had red flags. I know he’s been looked at by federal law enforcement,” DeSantis. said. “How the heck did it end up where he’s in West Palm Beach in those bushes?” More context: DeSantis, who has wielded executive power unlike any of his predecessors, has repeatedly leveraged state resources to thrust Florida into the national conversation, often by challenging the federal government or other conservative targets. It’s a playbook DeSantis has tapped into repeatedly in ways that have maximized his exposure, often in furtherance of his political ambitions. In 2022, as Congress and the federal government wrestled with a surge of border crossings, his administration lured migrants in Texas onto planes with promises of jobs and then dropped them off in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, without telling locals, setting off a national firestorm and a wave of glowing coverage from conservative media. Later, as he weighed whether to challenge to Trump for the Republican nomination for president, he pushed the Florida Supreme Court to empanel a statewide grand jury to investigate the Covid-19 vaccine developed under the former president’s Operation Warp Speed.

Tim Walz condemned the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday and said he’s “grateful” Trump is safe in his first on-camera reaction to what he called a “horrific situation.”  The Democratic vice presidential nominee addressed the incident at the beginning of his remarks to volunteers at a campaign field office in Macon, Georgia, on Tuesday, telling supporters “We don’t solve our difference in this country with violence.” Walz said that he was “thankful to Secret Service, the folks you see, law enforcement and grateful that the (former) president is safe,” Walz said. “I think all of us know, we don’t solve our differences in this country with violence. We condemn it in all its forms. We solve our differences at the ballot box. That’s how we get this done.” Walz is also set to campaign in North Carolina later today. Real estate investor Steve Witkoff, who was playing golf with former President Donald Trump during his second apparent assassination attempt, on Tuesday described his experience and shared his gratitude toward the Secret Service. He continued, “I was almost mesmerized by everything that was happening.” Trump’s round of golf with Witkoff on Sunday was ahead of the presidential candidate’s livestreamed announcement on Monday that he would be launching a new cryptocurrency venture, which Witkoff helped spearhead. “Our whole system, our whole country, runs on the availability of credit. And there are many who have been locked out of the marketplace, as I was when I first had a dream and wanted to be in the real estate business, and so that’s the reason we went into this business,” Witkoff explained. The man suspected of trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump on Sunday depicted himself on social media as a globe-trotting freedom fighter: tweeting at world leaders, traveling to Ukraine to support its war effort, and professing his willingness to die for the causes he believed in. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old living in Hawaii, told news outlets that he had spent months in Ukraine working to bring foreign fighters to the country from Afghanistan. But the grandiose image that Routh painted online didn’t seem to match up with his reality. In one interview last year, he acknowledged that he hadn’t secured a single visa for the Afghan fighters he claimed he was ready to send to the country, and a Ukrainian military official told CNN that Routh’s ideas seemed “delusional.” In the years before Routh’s alleged assassination attempt, he posted messages online criticizing Trump. Routh claimed in a 2020 post that he supported Trump in 2016 but had changed his tune on the former president. Away from his keyboard, Routh ran a small company that built tiny homes in a Honolulu suburb, and he spent his time writing letters to his local newspaper about homeless encampments, graffiti on an Oahu highway tunnel, and a dispute about a hiking trail.

As the investigation over the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump continues, the 2024 presidential candidates are hitting the campaign trail this week to make their pitch to voters in the final sprint to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting key swing states, while Trump is holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, will deliver remarks at a political event in Macon, Georgia, and then travel to Atlanta. Walz will then travel to North Carolina and deliver remarks at a Harris-Walz campaign rally in Asheville. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, and his running mate JD Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. Donald Trump and his children unveiled a new cryptocurrency business Monday night in a virtual address from his Mar-a-Lago estate, the latest venture that stands to benefit the former president as he seeks another four years in the Oval Office. Details on the new business, which will be called World Liberty Financial, remain limited, but his son Donald Trump Jr. suggested the new company will provide opportunities for people who cannot get financing from traditional banks. The GOP nominee has teased the latest expansion of his family’s business empire from the same social media account that carries his political messaging and shared vague thoughts Monday about the perceived upside. No major party nominee has ever leveraged their candidacy for personal profit quite like Trump has during his third White House bid. Since entering the race nearly two years ago, Trump has netted millions of dollars selling new items featuring moments from his political life while also generating billions of dollars in wealth through a social media site where he speaks directly to supporters. Read the full story. Donald Trump was walking down the fifth hole of the championship course at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, preparing for his birdie putt, when the all-too-familiar sound of gunfire prompted his Secret Service detail to pounce on the former president. Here’s a timeline of how the attempted shooting played out on Sunday: Read more about how the attempted shooting played out here. The Harris campaign and the Democratic National Committee have launched a new initiative to mobilize young voters across key battleground states. To mark National Voter Registration Day, the campaign and DNC announced a “Youth Week of Action” to encourage young voters to register to vote ahead of November’s election. The initiative consists of organizing on college campuses, paid maid media and an “aggressive campaign blitz across battleground states anchored by events with Gov. Tim Walz to ensure every eligible voter has a chance to make their voice heard by November 5.” Top surrogates will be deployed this week including Gov. Josh Shapiro hosting an event at Penn State University and Bill Nye speaking at a Climate Voters for Harris-Walz event in Durham, North Carolina. The campaign will support over 130 youth voter registration events this week alone. The week of action will also dedicate resources to target Black and Latino students in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-Serving Institutions where they will highlight “Trump’s Project 2025 would roll back student debt relief, monitor pregnancies and ban abortion and slash funding for these critical institutions.” The DNC has also unveiled the National Voter Assistance Text Line, which aims to provide information in English and Spanish so that voters can access information needed to register to vote. One of the best pollsters in America recently came out with its latest survey, and it’s good news for Kamala Harris. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll, conducted by Selzer & Co., found Donald Trump at 47% to the vice president’s 43% – within the margin of error – in a state the former president has twice won comfortably. (The poll was conducted last week, before Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Trump.) While the Hawkeye State is unlikely to be pivotal in November, the fact that Selzer found a close race in a state Trump has dominated could signal good things for Harris, both in terms of the accuracy of polling and for her chances in next-door Wisconsin. What makes the Selzer survey so important is that it’s been accurate in an era when other pollsters have struggled. This Selzer poll could also be an outlier, and much could change between now and Election Day. Selzer’s September 2020 poll was a lot more favorable to Biden (showing a tie) than its final survey that year. But the current poll is a far better result than the previous Selzer survey from June – when Biden was still in the race. It had Trump up by 18 points. The bottom line: You’d much rather have the Selzer poll in your corner than not. And right now, the survey shows a better result for Harris than it did in the end for either Clinton or Biden.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, will sit for an interview in Philadelphia with the members of the National Association of Black Journalists – a major unscripted moment for a candidate who has largely stuck tightly to her message. It’s the same group to whom Trump falsely said weeks ago that Harris only “happened to turn Black” in recent years.

Ex-President Donald Trump responded to a second apparent assassination attempt that he blames on incendiary political rhetoric by inflaming the situation even more. When a bullet grazed his ear in a horrific shooting that killed a rally goer in July, Trump initially acted like a changed man, telling The Washington Examiner’s Salena Zito he had a chance to bring the country and the world together — although that aspiration did not last any longer than the opening paragraphs of his convention speech. After the Secret Service thwarted a gunman who had apparently lain in wait for the ex-president at one of his Florida golf courses Sunday, Trump’s reaction was different. He accused President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of inviting assassins to target him when they warn that he is a threat to democracy. Trump’s claim that their warnings about his supposed threat to democracy risk getting him killed is particularly stark. By implication, he’s saying that it is illegitimate for his opponents to point out the truth: that his past behavior — in seeking to steal the 2020 election and spreading false claims that this year’s voting will be corrupt — suggests that he poses a danger to America’s democratic system. His position, which looks like an attempt to stifle free speech, may also be a dark harbinger of how he would behave if he won a second term. Read the full analysis here. Rob Rue, the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, said he didn’t think it was a good idea for former President Donald Trump to hold a campaign event in the city as Trump had suggested during a news conference Friday.  “It would be extremely difficult if either one of the candidates came to our community right now, and I would discourage it if I had the opportunity, just because this is not a time to campaign in our community at the national level,” Rue told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Monday.  Springfield has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have spread false claims that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in the town. Former President Donald Trump is still planning to attend scheduled campaign events this week following the apparent assassination attempt, two sources familiar with the schedule tell CNN. The schedule: Trump is expected to be in Flint, Michigan, today, Uniondale, New York, on Wednesday, and Washington, DC, this week."
Kamala Harris just got one of her best polls of the year | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:56 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T12:00:19.808Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/harris-trump-iowa-poll-wisconsin/index.html,"One of the best pollsters in America recently came out with its latest survey, and it’s good news for Kamala Harris. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll, conducted by Selzer & Co., found Donald Trump at 47% to the vice president’s 43% – within the margin of error – in a state the former president has twice won comfortably.

While the Hawkeye State is unlikely to be pivotal in November, the fact that Selzer found a close race in a state Trump has dominated could signal good things for Harris, both in terms of the accuracy of polling and for her chances in next-door Wisconsin. What makes the Selzer survey so important is that it’s been accurate in an era when other pollsters have struggled. Four years ago, it had Trump up in Iowa by 7 points days before the election, when other polls had Democrat Joe Biden in a much better position. I noted at the time that “this one poll is giving Trump backers hope and Democrats anxiety.” Democrats had good reason to worry. Not only did Trump end up winning Iowa by 8 points, he also vastly outperformed his polling in Wisconsin – nearly winning a state where he had trailed by high single-digits in preelection polling. Trump would do significantly better in many other battleground states as well. A similar scenario played out in 2016. Selzer’s final poll had Trump ahead by 7 points in Iowa. He went on to win the state (by 9 points) and the election over Hillary Clinton, doing better than most swing-state surveys said he would. This year, a lot of people, myself included, have wondered whether there could be another polling misfire. Even as many pollsters have tried to change how they conduct and/or weight their polls to prevent what happened in 2016 and 2020, they could still get it wrong. Selzer’s latest Iowa poll, however, suggests that other pollsters who show a race that is way too close to call are not underestimating Trump at this point. The result also makes sense when you look at the numbers coming out of neighboring Wisconsin, which has comparable demographics. Wisconsin is one of the seven battleground states where the polling remains tight. Harris, though, has received some of her best polling from the Badger State. The most recent poll from the reputed Marquette University Law School put Harris at 52% to Trump’s 48% among likely voters. An average of recent polls from Marquette, CBS News/YouGov and CNN/SSRS has Harris up by 4 points. A 4-point advantage is not wide and can easily be overcome by Trump, but it stands out among the other key swing states. Harris and Trump tend to be closer in the other six battleground states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania). Moreover, the 4-point Harris edge is better than Biden’s winning margin in Wisconsin in 2020 – 0.6 points. That result fell well short of the lead he had in preelection state polling. The Badger State polls also overestimated Clinton four years earlier to such an extent that she became the first Democrat to lose Wisconsin since 1984. The fact that the Selzer poll is indicating a similar shift in Harris’ favor in Iowa makes me think the Wisconsin polls may be on to something. Now, a win by Harris in Wisconsin would not guarantee her victory by any stretch. Even if you give her the state’s 10 electoral votes (along with the states already leaning her way), she’d need to carry at least two of the other six battleground states. Carrying Wisconsin, however, would improve Harris’ chances of winning. Instead of the race being roughly 50/50, most modelers would give her closer to a 75% chance of winning if she won Wisconsin. That’s a big shift in Harris’ direction. Still, a 75% chance of victory is not a guarantee of anything. Trump’s chance of winning would basically be the equivalent chance of a coin landing on heads in two consecutive tosses. This Selzer poll could also be an outlier, and much could change between now and Election Day. Selzer’s September 2020 poll was a lot more favorable to Biden (showing a tie) than its final survey that year. But the current poll is a far better result than the previous Selzer survey from June – when Biden was still in the race. It had Trump up by 18 points. The bottom line: You’d much rather have the Selzer poll in your corner than not. And right now, the survey shows a better result for Harris than it did in the end for either Clinton or Biden. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that polling overestimated Hillary Clinton’s margin in Wisconsin during the 2016 election."
Trump and Harris get back on the trail after another campaign-shaking moment | CNN Politics,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T10:00:19.807Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-campaign-tuesday/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump is set to hold his first rally Tuesday night since the second apparent assassination attempt of the former president, traveling to Flint, Michigan, for what’s being billed as a town hall hosted by his former White House press secretary, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, will sit for an interview in Philadelphia with the members of the National Association of Black Journalists – a major unscripted moment for a candidate who has largely stuck tightly to her message. It’s the same group to whom Trump falsely said weeks ago that Harris only “happened to turn Black” in recent years. The events come in the wake of the Secret Service on Sunday preventing a potential shooter from firing at Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course — stopping what could have been the second attempt on the former president’s life. They’ll offer a window into how the next phase of the campaign could play out — particularly for Trump, who is traveling to Michigan for an event that had been aimed at criticizing President Joe Biden and Harris’ record in one of the nation’s most important swing states. Trump on Monday unleashed a series of attacks, blaming Harris and Biden for this latest apparent attempt on his life. He argued Monday to Fox News Digital, in his first interview since the incident, that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.” He similarly lambasted the Democratic president and vice president on his Truth Social website. Biden conceded after the first assassination attempt it was a “mistake” to tell supporters he wanted to “put Trump in a bull’s-eye,” but neither he nor Harris showed any signs they would ease off their warnings about the danger Trump posed to democracy. At last week’s debate, Harris cited the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, the riots in Charlottesville and Trump’s prediction of a “bloodbath” should he lose as examples of his dangerous rhetoric. “Let’s turn the page on this,” she urged. Trump also has a long history of incendiary rhetoric and violent imagery – a point some Democrats made Monday. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said at a canvassing event for Harris’ campaign that Trump “plays to people’s fear, he plays to people’s anxiety. He defines us with hate and fear.” “This violence has to stop, but we also need to understand who and what he is and how much he is contributing to it,” Dingell said. Harris’ campaign on Monday sought to avoid discussing the apparent assassination attempt in a political manner. While the White House did not respond directly to Trump’s accusation that Sunday’s would-be shooter was acting upon his belief in “the rhetoric of Biden and Harris,” few aides believed the former president was speaking in good faith. Both Biden and Harris maintained their plans Monday following Sunday’s incident in Florida, a stark change from when Biden’s campaign pulled down its political advertising and canceled planned campaign travel by the president and vice president following the first attempt on Trump’s life over the summer. It’s a precarious moment for Trump’s campaign, with the first ballots going out at a time when the polling lead he held for the first half of the year has evaporated and his fundraising advantage is gone. Harris exited last week’s ABC debate with momentum, with 63% of debate-watchers saying the vice president turned in a better performance on stage in Philadelphia to Trump’s 37%, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS. A glaring warning sign for Trump came Sunday when a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll conducted by Ann Selzer – one of the nation’s most respected pollsters, and an expert in the Hawkeye State – found that Trump’s lead in Iowa was just 47% to Harris’ 43% among likely voters. The former president was up 50% to 32% against Biden in June, the same poll found. Iowa has not been expected to be a competitive state – Trump won there by 8 percentage points in 2020. But the poll found an uptick in the likelihood of voting among a number of Democratic-leaning groups, including women, college-educated Iowans, city-dwellers and those under age 45. An ABC News and Ipsos poll released Sunday found Harris with a lead over Trump nationally, with 52% support among likely voters to Trump’s 46%. It also found a clear gender gap: Women who are likely to vote break for Harris 55% to 44%, while male likely voters split evenly, 49% for each. Trump spent the hours after the apparent assassination attempt in Florida talking to allies and advisers on the phone, including while he was in lockdown at Trump International Golf Course. Multiple sources that spoke to him said that Trump seemed to be in good spirits. One source said Trump joked at that he was two under par at the time of the shooting and said he was in the middle of a “wonderful game of golf.” Another source said Trump asked what was being said in the media about the apparent second assassination attempt. A third source, who was briefed on a conversation with the former president, said he was adamant that he was going to win in November. Because of the circumstances around Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt, including Trump being quickly rushed to safety and placed under lockdown, Trump’s team was briefed far faster than they were after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, when some staff was left in limbo about Trump’s overall state for hours. While some close to Trump said that they were initially startled by the news there had been shots fired near the former president, they were also told immediately that Trump was safe and in a secure location. Trump’s Secret Service team quickly briefed members of the campaign on what had transpired while Trump was still in lockdown, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. What was starkly different about the Butler shooting and the Florida attempt, though, was how quickly Trump pivoted to political attacks. Following the shooting in Pennsylvania, the former president issued calls for unity – avoiding the immediate leap to political attacks that he made on Monday. That July shooting occurred when Biden was still in the race and struggling to overcome his poor June debate performance. Days later, Biden would exit, Harris would clinch the Democratic nod to replace him and Trump’s lead would vanish. The apparent assassination attempt on Trump over the weekend, which has once again prompted bipartisan condemnation of political violence, is also likely to fuel concerns about Harris’ safety when she is out on the campaign trail. The campaign has heard from numerous allies and supporters in recent weeks urging the team to avoid outdoor rallies altogether, believing that indoor events are much easier to secure, according to a source. Harris’ rallies have largely been indoors, except for two occasions – at a venue in Wisconsin and at a brewery in New Hampshire. The latter event was especially exposed, resulting in a large, protective glass box around the podium. While outdoor rallies aren’t completely off the table, the campaign is expected to continue to host most of its rallies indoors, according to a source familiar. The campaign, which for its part has been careful about trying to avoid any perception of politicizing Sunday’s incident in any way, is keenly sensitive to rhetoric that appears aimed at trying to incite violence against the former president. At a campaign event in Michigan over the summer, following the first attempted assassination of Trump, Harris acknowledged the delicate balance campaigns are forced to strike amid heightened political rhetoric. “On Sunday evening, our President Joe Biden issued a call for unity and there must be unity around the idea that while our nation’s history has been scarred by political violence, violence is never acceptable. There can be no equivocation about that,” she said at the July event. “At the same time, the hallmark of American democracy – the hallmark of any democracy – is a strong competition of ideas, policies and a vision for the future. And just as we must reject political violence, we must also embrace a robust discussion about what is at stake in this election,” she added."
Inside the fateful 12 hours of an apparent assassination attempt outside the Trump International Golf Club | CNN Politics,"Updated 5:54 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T09:00:19.862Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/inside-apparent-assassination-attempt-trump/index.html,"Donald Trump was walking down the fifth hole of the championship course at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, preparing for his birdie putt, when the all-too-familiar sound of gunfire prompted his Secret Service detail to pounce on the former president. This time, however, the only shots fired came from the gun of an agent protecting Trump, and not a gunman who had staked out the former president. Trump was whisked away to safety, unharmed, while the gunman, who officials believe remained near the tree-line perimeter of the golf course for 12 hours, fled the scene by car. Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Trump – the second in the past two months – has sparked a range of questions, including about the movements and motivations of the suspect now in custody and whether the Secret Service provided adequate protection for a last-minute golf outing. Investigators believe Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt, arrived to the tree-lined fence of the golf course’s southern perimeter on Summit Boulevard at 1:59 a.m. Sunday morning, based on the location data from his cell phone. Phone records from T-Mobile that indicated Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the golf course” for roughly 12 hours before he was first spotted by US Secret Service, according to charging documents. Jeffrey Veltri, special agent in charge of the FBI Miami Field Office, said at a Monday news conference, said that the cell-phone data indicated he was in “very close proximity to where he was spotted by the Secret Service.” Authorities found a sniper’s nest along the fence. Routh allegedly had an SKS-style rifle, with a scope and obliterated serial number. A backpack hung on the fence that contained ceramic tiles like those used in bulletproof vests. A GoPro camera and a black plastic bag with food were also hung on the course fence, according to a photo from the crime scene released Sunday. It’s still not clear why Routh went to the golf course that day. There was nothing on Trump’s public schedule, and the golf round was a last-minute add to Trump’s calendar –an “off-the-record movement,” acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe explained Monday. The temperature in West Palm Beach reached 90-degrees on the humid and cloudy September day, hardly ideal golfing weather. Still, Trump is a creature of habit and frequently golfs at the course while staying at Mar-a-Lago. On Sunday, the former president teed off the along with a donor, Steve Witkoff. By the fifth hole, Trump was having a good start to his round – Trump told Sean Hannity he was at even par, the Fox News host said after the incident on Sunday, while a source told CNN Trump joked that he was actually at two-under par and in the middle of a “wonderful game of golf.” Trump had a putt for birdie awaiting him on the fifth green, Hannity said the former president told him. While Trump was walking along the fifth hole, a long par-three over a water hazard, one of the teams of Secret Service agents protecting him was one hole ahead, sweeping the perimeter of the course on the sixth hole before Trump played it. At 1:31 p.m. ET, the agent on the course the perimeter spotted what appeared to be a rifle poking out of the tree line. He fired in the direction of the rifle, according to the criminal complaint. “As former President Trump was moving through the fifth fairway, across the course and out of sight of the sixth green, the agent, who was visually sweeping the area of the sixth green, saw the subject armed with what he perceived to be a rifle and immediately discharged his firearm,” Rowe said Monday. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said on Sunday that the Routh was roughly 300-to-500 yards from the former president. The would-be gunman never had a line of sight on the former president, Rowe said Monday, adding: “He did not fire or get off any shots at our agents.” Trump publicly recounted the incident for the first time Monday evening during an X Spaces conversation. “All of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets. But what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me, and I think probably the other one, Steve is one of the people. Steve Witkoff, a great friend of mine,” Trump said. “So we’re in the group and everybody just, we got into the carts, and we moved along pretty, pretty good,” he continued. “I was with an agent, and the agent did a fantastic job. There was no question that we were off that course. I would have loved to have sank that last putt, but we decided, let’s get out of here.” After the Secret Service agent fired at his position on the fence, Routh fled into in a black Nissan SUV, driving east toward I-95 and heading north on the freeway, officials said. Crucially, a witness nearby spotted Routh leaving the scene, and took a picture of his car and license plate. That allowed law enforcement officials across multiple jurisdictions to ultimately stop Routh’s vehicle about 45 minutes later in Martin County, more than 40 miles to the north of the golf course. The eyewitness provided “remarkable assistance” leading to the arrest of the suspect, Veltri said Monday. At about 1:55 p.m. ET Sunday, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office received a BOLO – or “be on the lookout” alert – about a suspect heading north on I-95, with a vehicle description and a tag number. Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said his agency “flooded” the highway. The area around where Routh was detained Sunday was “crawling with law enforcement,” he said. Every available unit – about 30 in all, he estimated – went out to search, Snyder said Monday. One patrol deputy saw the suspect vehicle at about mile marker 110 and alerted others, following it but not trying to immediately stop the vehicle, Snyder said. Instead, the deputy waited for two large F-250 pickup trucks to get in place on the highway and force the vehicle to a stop near State Route 714. Deputies conducted a felony stop at 2:14 p.m. ET, calling Routh out of the vehicle. He came back and was handcuffed, the sheriff said, and taken into custody, Snyder said. Routh was asked if he knew why he was stopped, and he answered “in the affirmative,” according to the affidavit supporting the criminal complaint. “His facial affect was so flat. His demeanor was relaxed,” Snyder said of Routh. “I honestly thought it looked like somebody that had just left the church picnic and was on his way home.” Routh was driving his daughter’s car when he was detained, according to a law enforcement source. The license plate on the Nissan SUV was registered to a 2012 white Ford truck that had been reported stolen, according to the charging documents. The witness who initially spotted Routh fleeing the golf course was flown by the Palm Beach County sheriff’s helicopter to the scene to identify Routh once he was in custody, Snyder told CNN’s Erin Burnett Monday evening. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office turned Routh over to the FBI and Secret Service once they arrived on the scene, Snyder added. Routh was charged Monday morning with two initial counts: possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Additional charges could be brought, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter told CNN."
Analysis: Trump pivots from second apparent assassination attempt to more incendiary claims | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:08 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T04:00:19.592Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/trump-incendiary-claims-analysis/index.html,"Ex-President Donald Trump responded to a second apparent assassination attempt that he blames on incendiary political rhetoric by inflaming the situation even more. When a bullet grazed his ear in a horrific shooting that killed a rally goer in July, Trump initially acted like a changed man, telling The Washington Examiner’s Salena Zito he had a chance to bring the country and the world together — although that aspiration did not last any longer than the opening paragraphs of his convention speech. After the Secret Service thwarted a gunman who had apparently lain in wait for the ex-president at one of his Florida golf courses Sunday, Trump’s reaction was different. He accused President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of inviting assassins to target him when they warn that he is a threat to democracy. He told Fox News Digital on Monday without evidence that the alleged would-be shooter “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.” Trump went on: “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.” “It is called the enemy from within,” he said using a familiar trope of totalitarian leaders. Trump warned that “dangerous fools” like the suspect in Sunday’s incident listen to what Democratic leaders say and react to what he has claimed, falsely, is an orchestrated attempt by the White House to use the justice system to persecute him. Trump’s running mate advanced an even blunter argument. “The big difference between conservatives and liberals is that … no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months,” Ohio Sen. JD Vance said. “I’d say that’s pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric and needs to cut this crap out.” The Republican vice-presidential nominee has recently denied he is guilty of incitement after his perpetuation of baseless claims that Haitian refugees have been eating pet dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, was followed by bomb threats to hospitals and schools. Democratic Rep. Nikema Williams condemned Vance’s remarks about assassinations and the difference between liberals and conservatives. “Would he want that? Why would you say that at a time when we’re talking about bringing down the temperature and changing the rhetoric and bringing the country together – unity – moving forward?” the Georgia Democrat said on “CNN This Morning” with Kasie Hunt. “We can disagree on policies, but we don’t want anyone to have an assassination attempt.” Williams said it was “no secret” that she’s not a Trump supporter, but that she doesn’t want anyone to face a threat on their life. She added that she’s had to arrange personal security measures since becoming a member of Congress to protect herself and her family after facing threats. The experience of being singled out for apparent attempted murder twice in two months would weigh on anyone. Trump is also facing an election, less than 50 days away, that is a dead heat between him and the vice president, according to most polls. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday that anyone who had been targeted for assassination “might be pretty sensitive, you might be pretty agitated, you might be pretty worried, so I think that is understandable.” And seeking to decide an election by murdering a candidate for president ought to be repugnant to anyone that believes in democracy and the right of voters to choose their leaders. The exact motives of the suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, are also not clear, although he was a longtime advocate for doing more to help Ukraine – a position that conflicts with Trump’s vow to end the war with Russia. And the connection between a politician’s rhetoric and actions taken by isolated individuals is often hard to pin down even if the fear is always that a small minority of people might be motivated by a leader’s comments to provoke violence. But Trump’s claims that Biden and Harris bear direct culpability underscore the extreme nature of his own political instincts. His claim that their warnings about his supposed threat to democracy risk getting him killed is particularly stark. By implication, he’s saying that it is illegitimate for his opponents to point out the truth: that his past behavior — in seeking to steal the 2020 election and spreading false claims that this year’s voting will be corrupt — suggests that he poses a danger to America’s democratic system. His position, which looks like an attempt to stifle free speech, may also be a dark harbinger of how he would behave if he won a second term. Trump played a similar political card at last week’s presidential debate when Harris raised his threat to terminate the Constitution and to weaponize the Justice Department against his political enemies. She said that since the Supreme Court and Vance wouldn’t stop Trump if he was back in the White House, “It’s up to the American people to stop him.” The vice president was clearly speaking in a political context, but Trump replied: “I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me.” Despite the fierce political exchanges, there was one moment that recalled lost political normality on Monday. Biden and Trump had a telephone conversation, and the president conveyed his relief that his erstwhile rival was safe. The Republican nominee said in a statement to CNN that it was “a very nice call.” Incitement and inflammatory rhetoric are often in the eye of the beholder. Republicans were angered, for instance, by Biden’s claim in August 2022 that the philosophical underpinning of the MAGA movement was like “semi-fascism.” (The charge did not become a staple of the president’s rhetoric). New York Rep. Daniel Goldman, a Democrat, said last year in an interview that Trump needed to be “eliminated” — a comment that Vance referenced on Monday. Goldman quickly apologized for his “poor choice of words” and said that he wished no harm to Trump. But if Democrats are to blame for sometimes going over the top, Trump has made a political brand out of the most outlandish rhetoric uttered by a president or ex-president in the modern history of the United States. The scale and intensity of his invective dwarf anything that the Democrats have flung at him. He calls Harris a “fascist” in almost every public appearance — for instance, he said on August 26 in Virginia that “we have a fascist person running who’s incompetent.” He used similar rhetoric on August 23, August 17, and August 3 in campaign appearances. Earlier this year, he claimed Biden was running a “Gestapo administration” referring to the genocidal Nazi secret police. He parroted the language of some of history’s worst tyrants by calling his political opponents “vermin” and by warning that immigrants were “poisoning the blood” of the United States. And when he refused to concede that he lost the 2020 election, Trump called supporters to Washington, DC, and told them to “fight like hell” or they wouldn’t have a country anymore. Then his supporters smashed their way into the US Capitol, to try to thwart the certification of Biden’s victory. Trump has since called those arrested over the events of January 6, 2021, political prisoners and said he’d look at pardoning them if he wins back the White House in November. Even now Trump is warning he will only accept the result of this year’s election if he deems it fair and has warned he will seek to jail officials and political opponents if he wins back power. “He plays to people’s fear, he plays to people’s anxiety. He defines us with hate and fear,” Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said Monday at a canvassing event for Harris. “This violence has to stop, but we also need to understand who and what he is and how much he is contributing to it,” she said, adding, “He has not said he’ll accept the election results.” Social media has often helped Trump inject bile into political life. After Sunday’s incident, one of his most prominent supporters — Elon Musk, who owns X — questioned why Trump had faced two apparent assassination attempts and his rivals had not encountered any. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala,” Musk wrote in the post that he later deleted. He later argued the post had been a joke, although given America’s violent political history and assassinations of four US presidents, it’s hard to see how people might find such quips funny. The rhetoric of Trump and his allies has also made life dangerous for others. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s former infectious diseases expert, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins this year that when he is assailed, for instance, by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in congressional hearings, the pace of death threats against him rises. “(There is) a segment of the population out there that believe that kind of nonsense,” Fauci said. Media organizations and election workers have also faced threats when on the wrong end of Trump’s baseless attacks. Prosecutors and judges need extra security while assigned to Trump cases and targeted by his daily screeds. And even as the shocking aftermath of another apparent attempt on Trump’s life plays out, the impact of his and Vance’s rhetoric is evident in Springfield, Ohio. After Trump amplified the false claims in the debate, Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine deployed the state highway patrol to monitor city schools that faced bomb threats. Elsewhere in Springfield, classes at Wittenberg University were held remotely Monday while campus police and local law enforcement assessed emailed threats of a bombing and a campus shooting that targeted “members of the Haitian community,” the university said. In his interview on “State of the Union,” Vance said that any suggestion that he or Trump had acted in a way that caused such threats was “disgusting.” It’s also disgusting that anyone would consider assassinating a former president running in a democratic election. Yet the historical record shows that while Trump has become a victim of a toxic political culture, he’s also one of its primary instigators."
Analysis: Trump pivots from second apparent assassination attempt to more incendiary claims | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:08 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T04:00:19.592Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/trump-incendiary-claims-analysis/index.html,"Ex-President Donald Trump responded to a second apparent assassination attempt that he blames on incendiary political rhetoric by inflaming the situation even more. When a bullet grazed his ear in a horrific shooting that killed a rally goer in July, Trump initially acted like a changed man, telling The Washington Examiner’s Salena Zito he had a chance to bring the country and the world together — although that aspiration did not last any longer than the opening paragraphs of his convention speech. After the Secret Service thwarted a gunman who had apparently lain in wait for the ex-president at one of his Florida golf courses Sunday, Trump’s reaction was different. He accused President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of inviting assassins to target him when they warn that he is a threat to democracy. He told Fox News Digital on Monday without evidence that the alleged would-be shooter “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.” Trump went on: “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.” “It is called the enemy from within,” he said using a familiar trope of totalitarian leaders. Trump warned that “dangerous fools” like the suspect in Sunday’s incident listen to what Democratic leaders say and react to what he has claimed, falsely, is an orchestrated attempt by the White House to use the justice system to persecute him. Trump’s running mate advanced an even blunter argument. “The big difference between conservatives and liberals is that … no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months,” Ohio Sen. JD Vance said. “I’d say that’s pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric and needs to cut this crap out.” The Republican vice-presidential nominee has recently denied he is guilty of incitement after his perpetuation of baseless claims that Haitian refugees have been eating pet dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, was followed by bomb threats to hospitals and schools.

‘All of a sudden we heard shots’: Trump recounts apparent assassination attempt | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:57 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-17T00:47:43.661Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/donald-trump-recounts-apparent-assassination-attempt/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump publicly recounted Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against him in detail for the first time, praising US Secret Service, other law enforcement and the witness who took a photo of the suspect’s car that helped lead to his apprehension. “I was playing golf with some of my friends, it was on a Sunday morning and very peaceful, very beautiful weather, everything was beautiful, it’s a nice place to be. And all of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets,” Trump said Monday during an X Spaces conversation in which he was expected to launch a new cryptocurrency business. “But what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me, and I think probably the other one, Steve is one of the people. Steve Witkoff, a great friend of mine.” Trump continued, “So we’re in the group and everybody just, we got into the carts, and we moved along pretty, pretty good. I was with an agent, and the agent did a fantastic job. There was no question that we were off that course. I would have loved to have sank that last putt, but we decided, let’s get out of here.” Trump recounted how the agent saw the barrel of the gun through the bushes. “He started shooting at the barrel, started shooting in the bushes. Could only see the barrel. How good is that? Right? Could only see the barrel. Based on that, he started shooting and ran toward the target and was shooting a lot, I mean, those were the shots we heard. The other one never got a shot off,” Trump said. Trump then described how law enforcement were able to detain the gunman with the help of a witness who saw the suspect run from the bushes and took a picture of his car. Trump praised the witness and said, “The civilian did a phenomenal job. A woman. I mean, who would think, you could take a thousand times like that, how many people would have the brainpower to follow him and take pictures of the back of his truck so that they end up getting, and the key was the license. So they got the license, and after they had the license, you know, there’s all sorts of technology where they can literally pinpoint where this truck is. I never knew something like that existed. And they pinpointed him on the highway.” Trump said, “It was quite something, but it worked out well and Secret Service did an excellent job, and they have the man behind bars, and hopefully he’s going to be there for a long time. Dangerous person, very, very dangerous person.” On Sunday, a Secret Service agent fired at a suspect, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the person, who fled in a car. The Secret Service later said the suspect had no line of sight on the former president. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, has been charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number in connection with the incident. He appeared in federal court Monday morning. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter told CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors seek to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate the incident. During the conversation on X, Trump said he needed more people on his security detail and suggested he told President Joe Biden as much when the president called him earlier in the day. “He was very nice today, he called up to make sure I was OK, to make sure that, you know, do I have any suggestions or any — we do need more people on my detail, because we have 50, 60,000 people showing up to events, and, you know, other people don’t have that, but he couldn’t have been nicer,” Trump said. Though Trump had previously confirmed the conversation with Biden and said the pair “had a very nice call,” he had also earlier sought to blame the president and Vice President Kamala Harris for the apparent attempt on his life, saying “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that “they are the real threat.” Biden told reporters Monday that he wants Congress to give the Secret Service “more help” in the wake of the incident.

Former Trump chief of staff loses bid to move Arizona election subversion case to federal court | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:32 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T23:43:09.893Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/mark-meadows-arizona-loss/index.html,"Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s former White House chief of staff, failed to convince a judge that his criminal case related to the 2020 election in Arizona should be moved to federal court, which could have made it easier to have the charges dismissed. Meadows similarly failed in his bid to move the criminal case against him in Georgia related to the 2020 election to federal court but has asked the US Supreme Court to weigh in. Meadows and 17 other Trump associates, including the fake electors from that state and several individuals connected to his campaign, were indicted earlier this year over their efforts to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss. Meadows has pleaded not guilty to the charges. US District Judge John Tuchi ruled that Meadows had mounted the effort too late and disagreed with his arguments as to why the “untimely” bid should be allowed to proceed. But Tuchi, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, also wrote in the 15-page ruling that Meadows had failed to show how the conduct at issue in his criminal case related to his official duties as Trump’s last chief of staff, an argument that Meadows has been pushing as he’s sought to avoid criminal prosecution. “The State’s charged conduct is unrelated to Mr. Meadows’s official duties,” the judge wrote Monday. “Although the Court credits Mr. Meadows’s theory that the Chief of Staff is responsible for acting as the President’s gatekeeper, that conclusion does not create a causal nexus between Mr. Meadows’s official authority and the charged conduct.” Meadows plans to appeal the judge’s ruling, according to a source close to Meadows’ legal team. CNN has reached out to Meadows’ attorney in Arizona for comment. Tuchi went on to criticize Meadows for what he described as an attempt by the former chief of staff to rewrite the state’s indictment against him. “Contrary to Mr. Meadows’s assertions, the State has not indicted Mr. Meadows for merely facilitating communication to and from the President or for simply staying abreast of campaign goings-on,” he wrote. “Instead, the State has indicted Mr. Meadows for allegedly orchestrating and participating in an illegal electioneering scheme. Few, if any, of the State’s factual allegations even resemble the secretarial duties that Mr. Meadows maintains are the subject of the indictment.” He continued: “None of the factual allegations at issue here mention management of the President’s time or facilitation of communication to and from the President, much less that any such time management or communication facilitation constitutes the charged conduct in this case. Similarly, contrary to Mr. Meadows’s reframing of the indictment, he is not being prosecuted for receiving text messages intended to simply keep him ‘apprised of what was happening’ with the Trump campaign.” This story has been updated with additional details."
Biden administration says number of illegal border crossings has drastically fallen as Trump seizes on immigration | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:25 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T21:40:28.919Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/border-crossings-immigration-biden-harris-trump/index.html,"US officials on Monday touted another month of low border crossings, citing recent executive action curbing asylum access at the US southern border, even as former President Donald Trump levels campaign attacks over the Biden administration’s handling of border security. Immigration and border security remain among the top issues for voters, and Trump has made them a cornerstone of his campaign, pinning blame on Vice President Kamala Harris over the handling of the US-Mexico border. But while border crises have dogged administration officials for the better part of Joe Biden’s presidency, the number of people illegally crossing the border over the last two months has drastically fallen. “The data published today by U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows that since President Biden announced new, decisive executive actions to secure the border on June 4, encounters between ports of entry have dropped significantly and remain at their lowest level in years - July and August saw the lowest encounter levels since September 2020,” White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández said in a statement. The administration, Fernández Hernández said, “has taken effective action, and Republican officials continue to do nothing.” In August, Border Patrol recorded about 58,000 encounters between ports of entry along the US southern border, slightly up from July but far below the record numbers in recent months. Encounters between ports of entry have decreased by more than 50% and are the lowest since September 2020, according to US Customs and Border Protection. In September 2020, Border Patrol recorded 54,771 encounters along the US southern border. Administration officials cite the executive action that Biden announced in June, which largely bars migrants from seeking asylum at the US southern border, for the dramatic decline in crossings. “CBP continues to enforce the Securing the Border interim final rule and deliver strong consequences for illegal entry, and encounters between ports of entry remain at their lowest level in years,” Troy A. Miller, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement. Migrants who are eligible can still apply to legally enter the United States through a mobile application, known as CBP One, or through a parole process set up for certain nationalities."
"From Ukraine to Hawaii, odd behavior of suspect in apparent Trump assassination attempt suggested ‘delusion of grandeur’ | CNN Politics","Updated 1:35 PM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-16T20:50:05.983Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/ryan-routh-trump-suspect-invs/index.html,"The man suspected of trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump on Sunday depicted himself on social media as a globe-trotting freedom fighter – tweeting at world leaders, traveling to Ukraine to support its war effort, and professing his willingness to die for the causes he believed in. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old homebuilder living in Hawaii, told news outlets that he had spent months in Ukraine working to bring foreign fighters to the country from Afghanistan. On Twitter, he implored President Joe Biden to “send every weapon we have to Ukraine” and offered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky advice on military strategy. But the grandiose image that Routh painted online didn’t seem to match up with his reality. In one interview last year, he acknowledged that he hadn’t secured a single visa for the Afghan fighters he claimed he was ready to send to the country, and a Ukrainian military official told CNN that Routh’s ideas seemed “delusional.” Away from his keyboard, Routh ran a small company that built tiny homes in a Honolulu suburb, and he spent his time writing letters to his local newspaper about homeless encampments, graffiti on an Oahu highway tunnel, and a dispute about a hiking trail. And Routh’s tweets to Biden, Zelensky, and other famous figures seem to have been ignored – until he was arrested in Florida this week, after allegedly waiting for Trump with an assault rifle outside the former president’s Palm Beach golf course. In what appears to be the second attempt to kill Trump in about two months, authorities said a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence while the Republican nominee played a round of golf. The agent opened fire, and Routh allegedly fled the scene by car without firing any shots back. Routh was later detained and has been charged with two counts, including possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. In the years before Routh’s alleged assassination attempt, he posted messages online criticizing Trump and showed a deep interest in supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia. Routh joined X, then known as Twitter, in January 2020, and immediately began posting about politics, according to tweets saved by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Routh claimed in a 2020 post that he supported Trump in 2016, but had changed his tune on the former president – writing that “I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment (sic) and it seems you are getting worse and devolving.” More recently, he suggested that Trump’s campaign slogan should be “make Americans slaves again.” In 2019 and 2020, according to Federal Election Commission records, Routh donated small amounts to the campaigns of Democratic presidential candidates Tulsi Gabbard, Beto O’Rourke, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. His tweets from the time include Routh calling then-candidate Joe Biden “sleepy Joe,” and criticizing him as someone who “stands for nothing; no plans, no ideas, just as limp as hillary.” Routh also displayed a sense of self-importance in messages to world leaders as early as 2020, when he tweeted repeatedly at North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. In one tweet, Routh wrote that “I would like to invite you to Hawaii for vacation. We would love to have you here and entertain you… I (am) a leader here and can arrange the whole trip. Please come.” In the days before and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Routh tweeted dozens of times about the conflict. “I am ready to go to Ukraine and fight and die,” he wrote in one post. And he tweeted directly at Zelensky, saying, “WE CAN GET THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS TO JOIN YOUR FIGHT–I am willing to be the example-I WILL FLY FROM AMERICA AND FIGHT WITH YOU… PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO RESPOND.” Zelensky did not appear to respond. Routh did follow through with his promise to travel to Ukraine, according to interviews with multiple people who met him there, as well as social media photos. But his efforts to support the country didn’t seem to go very far. According to a GoFundMe page posted by Routh’s fiancée, Kathleen Shaffer, he traveled to the country in April 2022. Photos geolocated by CNN show Routh posing with pro-Ukranian signs, as well as a large number of drones, at Kyiv’s Maidan Square. The GoFundMe page, which has since been taken down, raised $1,865 of its $2,500 goal, which Shaffer wrote would go toward tactical gear, lodging and supplies needed for volunteers. Shaffer wrote that Routh had already “arranged for delivery of 120 drones to the front lines,” though CNN could not verify those claims. In interviews with the New York Times and Semafor last year, Routh described his efforts to support Ukraine, including by trying to get fighters from Afghanistan to the country. He came off as frustrated by the lack of progress from his work – he told Semafor last year that in his meetings with Ukrainian officials, he had “got yelled at by most everyone.” A representative from Ukraine’s Land Forces Command foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted the command several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. “We can confirm this person reached out to us online multiple times. The best way to describe his messages is delusional ideas,” officer Oleksandr Shaguri said. “He was offering us large numbers of recruits from different countries but it was obvious to us his offers were not realistic. We didn’t even answer, there was nothing to answer to. He was never part of the Legion and didn’t cooperate with us in any way.” Michael Wasiura, a journalist who met and interviewed Routh in Ukraine in 2022, said that after Routh’s efforts to join the country’s International Legion were rejected, he set up a makeshift memorial in Kyiv for foreign soldiers who had died in the war. “He was out there every single day,” Wasiura said. “Talking to him, it was clear that you were not talking to a normal person. He was, manic might be the right word. He was extremely devoted. He was doing all of this just on his own personal initiative because he cared about the cause and was so extremely devoted to that cause that he’s essentially camping out in a foreign country.” Evelyn Aschenbrenner, an American citizen who served in Ukraine’s International Legion for two years, told CNN they warned Routh several times to go through official routes to recruit people to fight in Ukraine, but he just wouldn’t listen. Aschenbrenner showed CNN several messages they exchanged with Routh, in which Routh expressed anger with what he saw as Ukraine’s unwillingness to accept his help. “He seemed to have this delusion of grandeur thing,” Aschenbrenner said. “I’m like, ‘all you’re doing is causing headaches for everybody… the legion already has a recruiting website, there’s no need for you to be doing this.’” American Ryan O’Leary, an Army National Guard veteran who is fighting in Ukraine and encountered Routh in 2022, described him as being “off.” “I found him harmless, but not a person who should be in a war zone, as he was all over the place mentally,” O’Leary said. Last year, Routh appeared to have written a book about the war – “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen-Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity” – and was selling a digital version on Amazon for $2.99. In the book, he decried Trump as an “idiot,” a “buffoon” and a “fool,” and appeared to reference his previous support for Trump by writing, “I am man enough to say that I misjudged and made a terrible mistake.” At the same time, Routh also showed support for Taiwan. Routh claimed in online posts to be involved in the “Taiwan Foreign Legion,” a group allegedly recruiting foreign military personnel to fight for Taiwan in the event of a war with China. But several people listed as supporters on the group’s website told CNN they had no knowledge of the legion or its activities, and some had never heard of Routh before. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea, one of the people listed on the website, told CNN he met Routh in Kyiv’s Maidan Square in June 2022. Cernea interviewed Routh about his efforts to support Ukraine, and Routh said that “to me a lot of other conflicts are gray, but this conflict is definitely black and white. This is about good versus evil.” About a year later, Cernea said, he met Routh again and remembered him being visibly frustrated that more foreigners had not come to help Ukraine. Cernea said he was shocked to hear that Routh was arrested in connection with the Trump assassination attempt. “For me, it’s a surprise, because I viewed him as an idealistic, innocent, genuine person, without any murderous instinct,” Cernea said. In the years before his international efforts, however, Routh had a history of run-ins with the law in his native North Carolina. In 2002, the Greensboro News and Record newspaper reported that he had been arrested after barricading himself inside a local business with a machine gun. Court records show he was charged with felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges, and pleaded guilty. Tracy Fulk, a Greensboro police officer at the time, told CNN that the incident started when she pulled Routh over for a traffic stop. She said she saw a gun in his car, and after she pulled out her gun, he drove away and ran into his business. That led to a standoff with a police special response team, and Routh later surrendered, Fulk said. “He was a dangerous person,” Fulk said, adding that he was known to local law enforcement. But when he was arrested, she remembered, “he was very quiet and he didn’t really say a whole lot during my time with him.” In the following years, according to court records, Routh faced a litany of less serious criminal accusations, some of which were later dismissed. He was charged in multiple cases of writing worthless checks, and pleaded guilty to one such charge in 2003. In 2009 and 2010, he was charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance and possession of a stolen vehicle, both of which were dismissed, and he was found guilty of possession of stolen goods, for which he received three years of probation. The suspected would-be assassin also appeared to have some money problems – judges ordered him to pay tens of thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits filed against him, and state and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. Routh’s legal problems stand in stark contrast to what appears to be his first appearance in the news: A 25-year-old Routh was painted as local hero in a 1991 Greensboro News and Record article after he reportedly chased down and fought a suspected rapist. Routh received an award from local police for his actions and the newspaper referred to him as a “super citizen if not a super hero.” More recently, he moved to Hawaii, living near the ocean in Kaʻaʻawa, a town of about 1,200 people on the north shore of Oahu Island, public records show. Routh, who had previously worked in roofing, started a construction business that built tiny houses. He was featured in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser in 2019 for his efforts to house Hawaii’s homeless population. His company’s website, which includes photos and videos of Routh building simple houses out of what appears to be plywood, says its mission was to “produce solutions to our own problems right here on the island.” A Hawaiian man who gave Routh’s company a bad review on Facebook told CNN he was unsettled by Routh’s response to the criticism. Saili Levi, owner of a vanilla company, said he paid Routh $3,800 up front to build a trailer for his business, but when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy. When he asked Routh to improve the work, Levi said, Routh got angry. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said. “I kind of decided maybe I should just let it go for the sake of my family.” Routh also wrote several letters to the editor that were published in the Star-Advertiser newspaper, vowing to donate labor to build houses for homeless people, criticizing a plan to tear down an aging sports stadium as a “looming catastrophe,” and denouncing construction workers for failing to fill potholes. He even appeared to have considered a run for Honolulu mayor this year. A makeshift “Vote Ryan Routh” website, which lists contact information that matches Routh’s, contains nearly 70 posts addressing Routh’s views on access to historical sites, the island’s housing crisis, his proposed “war on termites” and the nuisance posed by roosters. In the posts, most of which were uploaded this summer, Routh described himself as being sober his entire life, and wrote that he had spent eight months in Ukraine. “We must push forward with logical leadership that supports the ones that wish to accomplish great things,” Routh wrote in one post. He did not appear on the ballot during the mayoral primary election last month. Routh’s eldest son, Oran, told CNN via text that Routh was “a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man.” “I don’t know what’s happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion,” the younger Routh wrote. “It doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent.” This story’s headline has been updated.

‘The Secret Service needs more help’: Trump protection scrutinized after apparent assassination attempt | CNN Politics,"Updated 5:04 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T19:49:49.226Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/secret-service-trump-second-assassination-attempt/index.html,"The second apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump in as many months is raising new alarms about whether the Secret Service can adequately protect the former president or whether more needs to be done to bolster the security of the Republican presidential candidate even though he’s not in office. While Secret Service agents on Sunday prevented the potential shooter from firing at Trump while golfing at his West Palm Beach course – unlike the would-be assassin in Butler, Pennsylvania – questions are again swirling about how another gunman was able to get within several hundred yards of the former president, especially given the outing was not a publicly announced event. “He’s a former president running for reelection again. We have to be able to keep him safe,” Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat and member of the congressional task force now investigating both assassination attempts, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Sunday. “This is getting embarrassing for the agency, and people in Congress are bewildered why we’re in this situation now for a second time.” While a sitting president is always afforded a different level of protection than candidates seeking the same office, a variety of credible threats against Trump and the first unsuccessful assassination attempt prompted the Secret Service to provide him with additional resources not usually offered to someone in his position. But after a second close call, even President Joe Biden recognized a problem still persists. “The Secret Service needs more help,” Biden told reporters while leaving the White House on Monday. Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe met with Trump and local law enforcement on Monday in Florida. At a press conference Monday afternoon, Rowe defended his agency’s response to the gunman, while saying that the Secret Service needed a “paradigm shift” in how they protect the country’s leaders. “The Secret Service’s protective methodologies work, and they are sound, and we saw that yesterday,” Rowe said. “But the way we are positioned now, in this dynamic threat environment, it has given me guidance to say you know what, we need to look at what our protective methodology is. We need to get out of a reactive model and get to a readiness model.” Rowe defended the security posture at the golf course and at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, emphasizing that the Sunday golf outing was an “off-the-record movement” and therefore was not on Trump’s calendar. The acting director argued “there’s not much difference” in security at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate between now and 2017, when the former president was in office. “When you look at that footprint” when Trump was president “and you look at it today, there’s not much difference there,” Rowe said. “There is heavy uniformed presence out there.” In July, the Secret Service’s failures were quickly apparent from Trump’s Butler rally, when a gunman was able to climb onto a roof 150 yards from the stage and fire eight shots at Trump, who was struck in the ear. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the fallout from the assassination attempt, leading to Rowe’s appointment as acting director. On Sunday, the Secret Service spotted the gunman before he could fire his SKS-style weapon, after an advance a team traveling ahead of the former president at the Trump International Golf Club saw the rifle barrel through the course’s fence. Agents fired at the gunman, who was about 300 to 500 yards away from Trump, and he fled in a black Nissan before being apprehended. Success in preventing the would-be gunman from firing any shots is being overshadowed by renewed questions about whether the Secret Service lacks the manpower, funding or operational flexibility to consistently protect the former president, particularly in similar outdoor settings, even as the agency’s budget has increased in the past decade. Those concerns were underscored by details revealed Monday about the suspected shooter’s whereabouts before he was ultimately spotted by Secret Service agents. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt, may have spent nearly 12 hours on Sunday near the area where he was spotted along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club, based on his cell-phone data, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. “The service needs to move away from thinking about Trump as a former president and start understanding the threat environment,” said Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst and former Secret Service special agent, citing both the domestic security challenges and the Iranian plot to try to assassinate Trump. “The intelligence community knows this is a credible threat,” he added, referring to Iran. “That alone means the perimeter needs to be pushed out further.” The agency’s sprawling protective missions will be tested again later this month, when world leaders descend on New York City for the annual meetings of the United Nations General Assembly. The Secret Service assumes security responsibility for all visiting foreign dignitaries, placing additional strain on its resources at the same time it is working to protect a former president along with the sitting vice president and president as they all hit the campaign trail. Trump’s Sunday golf round was a last-minute add to his calendar, according to sources familiar with the matter, meaning the Secret Service would not have had much time to secure the perimeter. And while the golf outing was not disclosed publicly, Trump is also a creature of habit and frequently golfs at the course while staying at Mar-a-Lago. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a Sunday news conference that the security protection levels for Trump are not the same as for sitting presidents. “The level where he is at right now, he is not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had the entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, security is limited to the areas the Secret Service deems possible,” Bradshaw said. “I would imagine the next time he comes to the golf course, there would probably be a little more people around the perimeter.” When the president travels, the Secret Service leans on other agencies in the federal government, such as the White House Communications Agency and the Department of Defense, to bolster cell coverage and provide bulletproof glass and other infrastructure. These security measures were not extended to presidential candidates and largely not needed for former presidents who aren’t holding large campaign-style events after leaving office. Since the July 13 shooting in Butler, the Secret Service has added its own mobile communications apparatus to create a private cellular network for Trump’s detail, both at his campaign events and to his motorcade, a federal source familiar with the planning told CNN. The agency also is surrounding Trump with ballistic glass at outdoor rallies and has increased the number of agents on his detail. “What you’re seeing is actually the protective structure moving closer to the vice-presidential level, which is a significant enhancement from what the protective model typically is for former presidents, such as former President Obama or Bush or Clinton,” Wackrow said. At a Senate hearing on the Butler assassination attempt in July, Rowe said the Secret Service had provided additional resources at the former president’s Mar-a-Lago residence, including investments of $4 million since Trump left office. Securing golf courses for presidents has long posed a unique challenge, including at Trump’s properties in particular, according to people familiar with the matter. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the president as he plays and secure the areas in the minutes before the president arrives. “Today, the model worked, where those agents that were flanking in advance of the president, their role specifically is to identify this type of specific long-range threat,” Wackrow said. “Now the question … is how is this shooter able to get to that outer perimeter, an area that, you know, should have been identified as a vulnerability previously?” Cheryl Tyler, a retired Secret Service special agent, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday that golf courses are challenging because the topography of the land can vary widely, along with factors such as other golfers on the course. “They’re all challenging,” Tyler said. “That being said, that protectee has the right to go play golf, swim, ski, do any sport activity. It is challenging for the Secret Service because we have to figure out the best way to make sure the protectee stays safe at all times. There’s no one-stop solution for that.” One potential unknown is how Trump would react to additional security measures, both at rallies and during visits to the golf course or his various clubs, which could restrict certain movements or impact the lifestyle he’s led since leaving the White House. At times, the Trump campaign has disagreed with the Secret Service over proposals intended to mitigate security concerns at his rallies, according to a source familiar with the interactions. Some solutions offered by the agency, such as having trucks lined up as a visual impediment, have been rejected by campaign officials because they didn’t like how it would look visually, according to the source. At the same time, Trump officials have pushed back on any suggestion that the campaign is in charge of security – placing that responsibility firmly at the feet of Secret Service. Moskowitz said Sunday that the Secret Service needed to consider taking more drastic measures, such as shutting down a significantly wider perimeter. “The Secret Service needs to start telling us whether or not they can actually keep someone safe in these circumstances unless they’re shutting down whole areas,” Moskowitz said. “And if that’s what we have to do, that’s what we have to do.” Top government officials, including Biden, are pointing to a lack of resources at the Secret Service in the fallout from the second assassination attempt. “The Secret Service must come to Congress tomorrow, tell us what resources are needed to expand the protective perimeter, & lets allocate it in a bipartisan vote the same day,” Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, posted on X on Sunday. However, the agency has already seen its funding expand dramatically over the past decade, including a 9% increase just this year to nearly $3.1 billion. In the “protective operations” category, used for security operations around “principals” such as the president, vice president and former presidents, the agency’s funding jumped 23% this year to $1.5 billion. It’s typical for the agency to be allocated more money during a year with a presidential election, and the 2024 funding far exceeds figures from 2016 and 2020. The levels set by Congress in its most recent funding bill exceed those requested by Biden in his yearly budget request. In his 2025 budget request submitted to Congress in May, the president proposed a reduction in overall funding for the Secret Service, to $2.9 billion. That includes a 14% cut to protective operations. Such a reduction would not necessarily be unusual for a non-election year, nor is the proposed budget binding on Congress. Asked at the July Senate hearing whether the Secret Service needed more money, Rowe said every agency in the executive branch “would take more resources.” The agency’s increase in funding over the past decade has not closed its staffing shortages, even as officials have said they are working urgently to hire more personnel. Instead, issues of culture could be at the root of the Secret Service’s staffing shortfalls. A survey of the best places to work in the federal government ranked the agency at No. 413, near the bottom of a list of 459 subcomponent agencies."
Trump launches another business full of potential risks and conflicts if he wins | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:24 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T19:00:19.790Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-business/index.html,"Donald Trump and his children unveiled a new cryptocurrency business Monday in a virtual address from his Mar-a-Lago estate, the latest venture that stands to benefit the former president as he seeks another four years in the Oval Office. Details on the new business, which will be called World Liberty Financial, remain limited, but his son Donald Trump Jr. suggested the new company will provide opportunities for people who cannot get financing from traditional banks. The GOP nominee himself has teased the latest expansion of his family’s business empire from the same social media account that carries his political messaging and shared vague thoughts Monday about the perceived upside. “It’s very young and very growing,” Trump said of the cryptocurrency industry. “I do believe in it.” The virtual event proceeded as planned despite Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on Trump while golfing at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Real estate investor Steve Witkoff, a close friend who was golfing with Trump during the episode, also joined the call and confirmed his involvement. No major party nominee has ever leveraged their candidacy for personal profit quite like Trump has during his third White House bid. Since entering the race nearly two years ago, Trump has netted millions of dollars selling new items featuring moments from his political life while also generating billions of dollars in wealth through a social media site where he speaks directly to supporters. His fans can buy coffee table books featuring pictures and letters from his presidency or, if they prefer, a Trump-themed Bible. He has sold $399 golden sneakers and recently advertised to supporters “fifty all new stunning digital trading cards” for purchase at a cost of $99 each. Buy 75 and get access to a dinner gala with Trump, plus pieces of a suit he wore in his debate against President Joe Biden. “These cards show me dancing and even holding some bitcoins,” Trump said in a video posted to Truth Social. But this latest enterprise, taking off just 50 days before the election, comes with a hornets nest of ethical conflicts should Trump win in November. On the campaign trail, the former president has promised to usher in a wave of policies favorable to digital currencies as he courted the votes and financial support of the bitcoin community. Now, a company he is helping to get off the ground could stand to benefit from the actions he takes in the Oval Office. There’s little precedent for a candidate creating such obvious overlapping obligations so close to an election, said Jordan Libowitz with the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “You generally see presidential candidates try to separate themselves from their conflicts of interest instead of bringing new ones into the fold,” Libowitz said. “It’s definitely new to see a president launching a new company while also at the same time talking up new policies that would potentially directly affect that company.” Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt who studies financial regulation and cryptocurrencies, said Trump’s new undertaking also raises questions about what would happen if it necessitates enforcement action by the next administration. It’s a reality that “needs to be taken seriously,” Yadav said, given the financial risks of a project that may attract hackers and investors “purely based on the celebrity of the former president and his family.” No law requires presidents to divest from their wealth before taking office, but those who have held the office have traditionally gone to great effort to assure voters they had disentangled their executive decision making from their personal finances to prevent even the appearance of impropriety. President Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a blind trust before he took office. President Ronald Reagan and his Vice President George H.W. Bush moved their considerable wealth into trusts, too. Trump, though, shattered historical norms in his first term when he turned over his businesses to his two sons instead of divesting or shielding himself from the management of the family’s transnational conglomerate. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about these concerns, while also insisting that his latest project would not distract from the former president’s intensifying race against Vice President Kamala Haris, now in the home stretch. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung argued that Trump has “out-worked” Harris and would continue to. “There is nobody more committed than President Trump to save America from the weak, failed, and dangerously liberal policies of Kamala,” Cheung said. Trump was a businessman long before he entered politics and he has cashed in on his fame for decades, putting his name on everything from buildings to steaks. The businesses Trump has launched while campaigning have proven quite lucrative for the lifelong dealmaker. Trump made about $7.2 million in 2023 through a licensing deal with NFT INT, LLC, the company that is selling digital NFT, or non-fungible token, “trading cards” featuring the former president, according to financial disclosures he filed in August. In December, Trump began selling special edition NFTs featuring his Georgia mugshot after he was indicted on charges related to his failed attempts to overturn the 2020 election there. Those willing to buy the full set were offered a special physical card with pieces of the blue suit and red tie Trump wore in the photo. The price? $4,653. Advertisements of Trump promoting the NFT deals are shot in nearly identical fashion to videos his campaign released of the former president announcing his agenda for a second term. In both the infomercials and the campaign videos, Trump, wearing a navy suit, appears positioned with American flags on either side of him as he makes a direct-to-camera pitch from inside the same Mar-a-Lago room. “It was a great suit, believe me, a really good suit,” Trump said in the video for the mugshot NFTs. “It’s all cut up, and you’re gonna get a piece of it.” Trump reported making more than $5 million through another business, CIC Ventures LLC, largely in royalties from his books “Letters to Trump” and “Our Journey Together.” He also reported making $300,000 in royalties from “The Greenwood Bible,” a venture associated with country singer Lee Greenwood. The bibles have since been renamed the “God Bless the USA Bible” after the Greenwood anthem that plays when Trump enters his campaign events. “Happy Holy Week! Let’s Make America Pray Again. As we lead into Good Friday and Easter, I encourage you to get a copy of the God Bless the USA Bible,” Trump wrote in a March social media post that directed his supporters to a website selling the book for $59.99. The launch of these new licensing deals and products have come as mounting legal bills and court defeats have proven costly for the former president. His line of golden sneakers debuted a day after a Manhattan judge ordered Trump to pay over $454 million as part of a civil fraud case. He first hawked the shoes at a Philadelphia conference for sneakerheads, and then appeared hours later at a rally in Michigan – an illustration of how Trump has also mixed business with the campaign trail. The largest share of Trump’s net worth, at least on paper, is his ownership share of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of the Truth Social social media network he started in his post presidency after he was kicked off other sites. Trump reported in his disclosure owning nearly 115 million shares of the company’s common stock. Speaking to reporters Friday in Los Angeles, he insisted he had no plans to sell his majority stake in Trump Media. A lockup clause that prevents Trump from shedding shares until six months after the company went public is scheduled to end later this month. The episode provided an example of how the former president, in a matter of moments, can cause his net worth to fluctuate by nine figures just by opening his mouth. Trump Media stock, which has fallen sharply in recent months, jumped 25% after Trump’s remarks Friday. Perhaps none of Trump’s post-presidency endeavors to date, however unusual, present the potential for ethical quandaries quite like his next venture. Trump did not divulge the extent of his involvement, though Witkoff said he worked with Trump and his children for nine months on the project. Other details about World Liberty Financial remain sparse, but Trump’s oldest son argued the banking system has become biased and politicized, using his own family’s difficulties getting credit lately as an example. “This is going to be an evolution,” Trump Jr. said. Others on the call said the goal is to get everyday people involved in the cryptocurrency marketplace. In launching World Liberty Financial, Trump and his family are entering a nascent industry that has clashed with federal regulators as it seeks to gain legitimacy. The next president is certain to confront questions about whether to put guardrails around or encourage growth in this burgeoning but highly speculative sector of financial technology. “He would be in a position to directly impact the fortunes of this company,” Libowitz said. Trump, who once dismissed bitcoin as “not money,” has already made several cryptocurrency-friendly policy commitments. He pledged to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whose bearish outlook on cryptocurrency has made him a regular target of their scorn, and promised to create a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump told the industry’s largest annual gathering this summer. His support came as cryptocurrency leaders and investors have donated millions of dollars to his campaign and aligned political committees. Trump’s campaign has not explained the former president’s 180-degree turn on bitcoin or the potential conflicts raised by this new crypto project. Brian Hughes, an adviser for the campaign, told CNN in a statement that Trump “is ready to encourage American leadership in this and other emerging technologies.” While Trump’s about face on bitcoin was cheered on by the industry, there is growing concern that his personal interest in cryptocurrency is the latest example of a celebrity looking to capitalize on a buzzy new investment opportunity. “A lot of projects have been building in this space for years with experienced teams and audited systems,” said Gareth Rhodes, an attorney at the regulatory firm Pacific Street and a former financial regulator for the state of New York. “Is this going to be part of that group of companies or is it more of a barometer of his political prospects like a meme coin or his media stock, which fluctuates whether people think he’s going to win the election?” “Most people I talk to think it’s going to be in the latter camp but they’re waiting to see what the product is,” Rhodes added. There are also potential security risks of having a president closely involved in an industry that has already suffered serious setbacks from high-profile fraud cases as well as orchestrated hacks by nefarious actors, sometimes in foreign countries. Nic Carter, a crypto investor who supports Trump, warned on X that the new company would be “the juiciest DeFi target ever” for hackers, using a shorthand term for “decentralized finance.” “At best it’s an unnecessary distraction, at worst it’s a huge embarrassment and source of (additional) legal trouble,” Carter wrote. Yadav, the Vanderbilt professor, agreed, saying it could “damage his credibility as the crypto-president if the venture fails or results in members of his voter base losing their funds.” Already, hackers posted messages on X accounts of Trump’s daughter Tiffany and his daughter-in-law Lara that linked their followers to a fake World Liberty Financial website. Meanwhile, the biography for the real X account of World Liberty Financial reads like an omen of these potential pitfalls. “Beware of Scams!” it says. “Fake tokens & airdrop offers are circulating. We aren’t live yet!” This headline and story have been updated with additional details from Monday’s event."

Trump’s social media stock reacts to latest security scare | CNN Business,"Published 11:39 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T15:39:31.651Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/business/trump-stock-security-incident-truth-social/index.html,"Shares of Donald Trump’s social media company are experiencing another bout of turbulence following the latest assassination attempt against the former president and face of Truth Social. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) initially climbed 5% in premarket trading early Monday in the wake of the Sunday security incident.But in late morning trading, the Truth Social owner’s share price was down 4%. The reaction on Wall Street represents a far more muted response compared to the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Trump at a Pennsylvania rally in July. After the former president emerged defiant from that shooting, Trump Media skyrocketed as much as 50% the next trading day before closing up by 31%. Experts have compared Trump Media to a meme stock because it tends to trade on sentiment and hype, not fundamentals. And even though it brings in little revenue, the conservative social media company continues to be valued in the billions of dollars. The former president himself set off the latest turbulence on Friday when he declared he won’t sell shares in the company. “No, I’m not selling. No, I love it,” Trump said at a press conference in response to a question from a reporter. Lock-up restrictions preventing Trump and other insiders from selling shares expire as soon as Thursday. That event has been hanging over the stock for weeks. Trump Media’s share price exploded higher on Trump’s comments, spiking as much as 30%. The surge was so great that Nasdaq halted trading in the stock twice. Trump Media finished the day up by 12%, its best performance in three weeks. Trump lashed out at Nasdaq over the trading halt, suggesting something nefarious was at play. Yet such trading pauses are common across the US stock market. They are required by federal regulators and designed to provide a cooling-off period for stocks experiencing rapid increases or decreases in price. Investors who bought Trump Media when it went public this March remain deeply in the red. The stock is down roughly 74% from its March 27 closing high of $66.22. Trump’s stake of 114.75 million shares is still worth about $2 billion, but that’s down from $6.2 billion as recently as May 9."
"Suspect in apparent assassination attempt of Trump charged, may have been lying in wait for nearly 12 hours | CNN Politics","Updated 9:44 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T13:36:01.825Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/trump-assassination-court-developments/index.html,"Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, may have been lying in wait for nearly 12 hours along the tree line at Trump’s golf club, authorities said in a criminal complaint on Monday. Routh, 58, was charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number during an initial appearance in federal court Monday morning. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter told CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors seek to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate the incident. Wearing dark prison scrubs, his feet and hands shackled, Routh nodded and answered “yes” to questions asked by Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe. McCabe found Routh could not afford his own attorney after Routh said he had “zero funds” in his own savings. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. A detention hearing has been set for September 23, and the arraignment is set for September 30. Routh will be held in jail while he awaits trial. The incident happened about 1:30 p.m. ET Sunday after a Secret Service agent noticed the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence between the 5th and 6th hole of Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, Florida, in a tree line near a heavily traveled road. Cell-phone data indicates Routh may have spent nearly 12 hours on Sunday near the area where he was spotted in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. An FBI agent said in an affidavit filed in court that during their initial investigation, authorities got phone records from T-Mobile that indicated Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the area” where he was first spotted by US Secret Service from around 1:59 a.m. ET Sunday until 1:31 p.m. ET, when a Secret Service agent saw his rifle poking out from a tree line. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. The Secret Service later said Routh had no line of sight on the former president. Trump recounted the apparent assassination attempt against him in detail Monday night during an X Spaces conversation in which he launched a new cryptocurrency business. “I was playing golf with some of my friends, it was on a Sunday morning and very peaceful, very beautiful weather, everything was beautiful, it’s a nice place to be. And all of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets. But what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me,” Trump said, going on to describe how the agent saw the barrel of the gun through the bushes. Along the fence line, authorities found a sniper’s nest which included a scoped rifle, a GoPro camera and backpacks with ceramic plates. “This whole set-up indicates a very high level of pre-planning,” former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told CNN. Routh was driving his daughter’s car when he was later detained, according to a law enforcement source. A picture released by the Martin County Sheriff’s Office after he was detained showed him wearing a long-sleeved, salmon-colored shirt with his hands cuffed behind his back. Routh remained silent while being detained, local state attorney David Aronberg told CNN. Trump’s golf outing was not on his public schedule and it’s not yet clear how Routh allegedly knew where Trump would be at that moment. Aronberg said Routh will face federal, not state charges. He told MSNBC that Florida initially considered pursuing state charges, but stood down when federal agents took over the case. On social media, Routh was a staunch supporter of Ukraine who said he supported Trump in 2016 but later became disillusioned with the former president. He’s been frequently critical of Trump recently. Routh traveled to Ukraine following Russia’s invasion two years ago, attending a rally in Kyiv on May 1, 2022. Representatives for Ukraine’s foreign legion said Routh contacted them several times but distanced themselves from Routh. Oleksandr Shaguri, an officer of the Foreigners Coordination Department of the Land Forces Command, told CNN over the phone that “the best way to describe his messages is – delusional ideas.” Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri said Monday that Routh had a very active online presence and that authorities were still going through his social media. “In addition, we’re going through media reports and public statements he made that he wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers and others to fight for Ukraine,” said Veltri, of the Miami field office. “The FBI has sent multiple requests to companies for returns on the subject’s phone and social media accounts.” The FBI is working with its partners to pursue search warrants for Routh’s vehicle, cell phone and other devices, Veltri added. Routh’s son Oran Routh called him a “good father, and a great man” in a statement on Sunday. Aronberg told MSNBC there may be grounds to charge Routh with being in possession of a firearm as an ex-felon and aggravated assault against a federal law enforcement officer for pointing the rifle at the Secret Service agent. However, it may be difficult to charge Routh with a crime against Trump specifically. Aronberg said the distance between Routh and Trump, between 300 to 500 yards, might be too far for the court to be certain Routh was aiming his rifle at Trump. Instead, Aronberg said it will be much easier to charge Routh with aiming at the Secret Service agent who saw the rifle barrel pointed at him. “That’s the key witness here and that would be, perhaps, the most serious charge,” Aronberg said. When asked about the possibility of an insanity argument, Aronberg said it will be very difficult to argue because Routh fled the scene, which showed he was aware his actions were wrong. “You can explain it as the fact this guy’s got a screw loose,” Aronberg said, “(but that) doesn’t mean he’s legally insane under the law, that’s a higher burden.” President Joe Biden spoke with his predecessor Monday afternoon and the two men had a “cordial conversation,” White House spokesperson Emilie Simons wrote on X. Biden also conveyed his relief that Trump was safe and the former president expressed his thanks for the call, Simons said. Trump confirmed the call later Monday, saying in a statement provided to CNN: “We had a very nice call. It was about Secret Service protection.” Earlier in the day, Biden told reporters that he wants Congress to give the US Secret Service “more help” in the wake of Sunday’s incident. “Thank God the president is OK,” Biden told reporters Monday morning. He said he thought there was a “full report so far.” “The one thing I want to make clear is (the Secret Service) needs more help, and I think the Congress should respond to their needs if they, in fact, need more Service people,” Biden said at the White House, shortly before leaving for Delaware and Pennsylvania. “So that’s what we’re going to be talking about.” Asked what kind of help they needed, Biden responded, “I think we need some more personnel.” “I think they may need – they’re deciding whether they need more personnel or not,” Biden said. Staffing issues have plagued the Secret Service for years. Agents and officers have described feeling burned out by overtime shifts and long assignments, leading to high turnover. Then-USSS Director Kim Cheatle told Congress over the summer that the agency currently has 8,000 employees but that its goal was to reach 9,500. On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris said, “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence.” “I am thankful that former President Trump is safe,” she added. Coming 51 days before the election, the apparent attempt on the former president’s life is the latest escalation in what has been an extremely bitter political campaign — including another assassination attempt that wounded Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 and a separate Iranian plot against Trump that was foiled earlier this year. It left Biden and Harris once again having to decry political violence. Biden was briefed about the attempt on Trump’s life shortly after it was foiled and released a statement saying he was “relieved” Trump was unharmed and that “there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country.” Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Trump sought to blame Biden and Harris for the apparent attempt on his life, saying “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at.” “He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital of Routh. Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden kicked off his 2024 campaign that he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power.” Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.” Trump frequently uses inflammatory rhetoric when attacking his political rivals, judges overseeing his criminal cases, prosecutors who have brought charges against him, undocumented immigrants, people who don’t support his campaign and others. Trump has vowed retribution if he is reelected and has repeatedly suggested he would weaponize the justice system to prosecute his political opponents. Trump also recently threatened prosecution and “long-term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election. Harris is scheduled to attend a campaign meeting in Washington Monday afternoon, according to guidance from her campaign office. CNN previously reported Harris would also attend a rank-and-file roundtable with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington on Monday. Trump will appear at the launch for a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago home Monday evening. This story has been updated with additional developments."
Elon Musk deletes post questioning the Trump assassination attempt | CNN Business,"Updated 7:27 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T13:22:41.693Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/tech/elon-musk-biden-trump-assassination-attempt/index.html,"Elon Musk deleted a post Monday morning that questioned why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. Musk later claimed the post was a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. Musk initially resisted numerous calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But Musk was ultimately persuaded by an X post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. “Fair enough. I don’t want to do what they have done, even in jest,” Musk responded. He later posted several times that the deleted post had been a joke. However, Musk subsequently responded to a similar post, replying with a thinking face emoji to a photo that noted the four presidents who preceded Trump faced no assassination attempts when Trump has apparently encountered two. X did not respond to a request for comment. The White House called Musk’s comments “irresponsible.” “As President Biden and Vice President Harris said after yesterday’s disturbing news, ‘there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country,’ and ‘we all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,’” said White House spokesperson Andrew Bates in a statement. “Violence should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about.” The Secret Service said it has seen Musk’s deleted post but declined to comment on any action it may be taking as a result of it. “As a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence,” a Secret Service spokesman told CNN. “We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.” The Secret Service is tasked with investigating perceived threats against the president and vice president – sometimes even if they are made in jest. The Secret Service in 2021 investigated a joke comedian John Mulaney made on “Saturday Night Live” comparing Trump to Julius Cesar, who was assassinated. It’s unclear if Musk, who owns X, violated X’s terms of service with those posts. He has routinely flouted his platform’s rules with few consequences. X said it restricts “engaging in or promoting violent acts,” although Musk denied he was calling for violence. Musk endorsed Trump for president after an assassination attempt in July, and he hosted Trump last month in an interview on X. It’s part of a rightward shift for Musk that has gained steam in recent years. Musk, the richest person in the world,  decries what he calls progressives’ “woke mind virus.” And he has warned of America’s impending “doom” if Democrats maintain control of the White House. But Musk’s posts aren’t just run-of-the-mill political chatter. He has increasingly engaged in conspiracy theories, including the false claim that the Biden administration allows undocumented immigrants to vote in US elections. He has also pushed the boundaries – or blown right past them – by posting fake images and using bigoted language in support of his causes. For example, Musk has posted numerous AI-generated images of Harris, including depicting her speaking before a crowd filled with communist imagery and symbols. And after Taylor Swift endorsed Harris for president that she signed “childless cat lady,” Musk responded with a widely criticized post: “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.” It’s the latest illustration of how few guardrails exist on the X platform."
"What we know about Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent second Trump assassination attempt | CNN","Updated 12:14 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T11:53:33.352Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/us/ryan-routh-trump-what-we-know-intl-hnk/index.html,"Ryan Wesley Routh put his enmity toward Donald Trump – the man he once supported but then dismissed as an “idiot,” a “buffoon” and a “fool” – at the center of a rambling and fanciful worldview that also fixated on Ukraine, Taiwan, North Korea, and what he called the “end of humanity.” The 58-year-old, who was detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on the former president, protested in Kyiv after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and committed his ideas to paper in a self-published 291-page book. Authorities suspect Routh, who owns a small construction company in Hawaii, was planning to attack the former President as he played a round of golf on Sunday, with US Secret Service agents firing at a man with a rifle in the bushes near the golf club. He was later apprehended after being stopped on a nearby highway. Routh appeared in federal court Monday and was charged with two counts, possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. For years, he criticized not only Trump but himself, describing Trump as “my choice” in the 2016 presidential election but later writing that he is “man enough to say that I misjudged and made a terrible mistake.” Here’s what we know about Routh so far. Routh’s thoughts and fixations on global politics appeared idealistic to some who came across him, but his writings show how he became increasingly militant about the geopolitical forces he railed against. His business pursuits, by contrast, appear relatively unremarkable. On Routh’s LinkedIn page, he said he started a company in 2018 called Camp Box Honolulu in Hawaii, which builds storage units and tiny houses. A story in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser said he donated a structure for homeless people. During his court appearance on Monday, Routh said he was making $3,000 a month before his arrest, had “zero funds” in savings and had no assets beyond two trucks in Hawaii. Routh also has ties to North Carolina, where public records show he registered as an “unaffiliated” voter without a party in 2012. He voted in that state’s Democratic primary in March of this year, according to public records. Records from the state dating back decades also show Routh has had previous scrapes with the law – including being arrested in 2002 after he was pulled over by police and allegedly put his hand on a firearm, and then drove off and barricaded himself in a business premises. He has also been involved in several court cases since the 1990s, with authorities repeatedly accusing him of failing to pay his taxes on time. Separately, judges have ordered him to pay tens of thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits. Routh became animated when writing about Trump, and he frequently weighed in on US and global current events on social media. In June 2020, Routh appeared to say that he had voted for Trump in 2016, but that he had since withdrawn his support of the former president. “I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment and it seems you are getting worse and devolving,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I will be glad when you gone.” Routh also mentioned Trump in his book, which appears on Amazon without a publisher listed, and is titled “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen-Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity.” In that publication, he described the former US president’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 as a “tremendous blunder” that drove Tehran closer to Moscow, which it then supplied with drones that have caused devastation across Ukraine. He even commented on the first assassination attempt on Trump, when the former president was wounded by a gunshot during a rally in Pennsylvania in July. Routh encouraged President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to visit those wounded in the incident, saying: “Trump will never do anything.” Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s 2022 invasion also became central to Routh’s philosophy; he expressed support for Ukraine in dozens of X posts that year, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.” He also visited Ukraine in 2022, according to video and photos geolocated by CNN and interviews he gave to international media during his time there. In a flurry of Facebook posts last year, he tried to enlist Afghan conscripts to fight in the war, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government. A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion confirmed with CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but said he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Oleksandr Shaguri, an officer of the Foreigners Coordination Department of the Land Forces Command, told CNN over the phone that “the best way to describe his messages is – delusional ideas.” “He was offering us large numbers of recruits from different countries but it was obvious to us his offers were not realistic. We didn’t even answer, there was nothing to answer to. He was never part of the Legion and didn’t cooperate with us in any way.” Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June 2022, where the American was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. “For me, it’s a surprise because I viewed him as an idealistic innocent genuine person, without any murderous instinct,” Cernea told CNN following news of Routh’s detention in the United States. According to Cernea, Routh described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “black and white… good versus evil” conflict. In an interview with AFP news agency from Kyiv in April 2022, Routh said: “Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the globe to stop what they’re doing and come here now and support the Ukrainians to end this war.” He also weighed in on the political situations in Afghanistan, Taiwan and North Korea in his book. Routh has repeatedly voiced support for Taiwan and previously called for international intervention to protect the island against potential Chinese encroachment. Routh’s eldest son, Oran, told CNN via text that Routh was “a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man.” “I don’t know what’s happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I’ve heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent,” Oran wrote. But other people have shared testimonies of tense interactions with Routh. Hawaiian business owner Saili Levi told CNN he had paid Routh $3,800 up front to build a trailer for his business. But when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy, he said. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. “I kind of decided maybe I should just let it go for the sake of my family,” Levi recalled.

Live updates: Trump apparent assassination attempt on Florida golf course | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-16T10:54:15.892Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-assassination-attempt-election-news-09-16-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Read the latest on the apparent Trump assassination attempt here The suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump has been hit with two gun-related charges.   As the Secret Service, FBI and local authorities investigate further, the Republican presidential nominee and his running mate, JD Vance, are blaming the rhetoric of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, with Trump saying the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.”  Here are the latest developments:  Hillary Clinton said she was “surprised, shocked even” by Joe Biden’s performance during his debate with Donald Trump, saying “it just couldn’t be recovered” and that the president “made the right decision” to endorse Kamala Harris. Clinton said she was “thrilled” that Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee. She also complimented Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, calling the Minnesota governor “such a breath of fresh air.” Clinton was asked if she could envision herself serving in a potential Harris administration, and she quickly dismissed the possibility. The Harris-Walz campaign is leveraging the deep legal network of Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff for a series of fundraisers this week, according to people familiar with the matter. Emhoff is headlining a virtual event Tuesday, featuring former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former White House counsel Dana Remus, and former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, with hundreds of practicing lawyers from white-shoe firms and blue-chip companies expected to attend. Organizers say they expect the event to raise millions of dollars. The program for the event is expected to touch on the importance of the rule of law, election integrity and voter protection. According to one source, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had been expected to participate. Having served as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general, Harris has crossed paths with multiple attorneys. Emhoff has served as a law partner at firms DLA Piper and Venable — lucrative roles where he developed his own Rolodex and cultivated clients in entertainment law. The industry has come out in full force for Harris. Former acting Solicitor General and Trump critic Neal Katyal, now a partner at Hogan Lovells, is hosting another fundraising event for Harris on Wednesday. Former Democratic acting Attorney General Sally Yates hosted an August reception for attorneys in Los Angeles shortly after Harris ascended to the top of the ticket. And several other lunches and receptions have popped up as other law firm partners have tapped their networks for Harris. Rob Rue, the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, said he didn’t think it was a good idea for former President Donald Trump to hold a campaign event in the city as Trump had suggested during a news conference Friday.  “It would be extremely difficult if either one of the candidates came to our community right now, and I would discourage it if I had the opportunity, just because this is not a time to campaign in our community at the national level,” Rue told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Monday.  Springfield has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have spread false claims that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in the town. A sheriff in Ohio is appearing to encourage people to write down the addresses of supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.  Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski made the comments on his Facebook account.  “When people ask me…What’s gonna happen if the Flip - Flopping, Laughing Hyena Wins??,” Bruce Zuchowski wrote Friday about Harris. “I say…write down all the addresses of the people who had her signs in their yards! Sooo…when the Illegal human ‘Locus’ (which she supports!) Need places to live…We’ll already have the addresses of the their New families…who supported their arrival!” Zuchowski’s post included screen grabs from recent Fox News stories that read: “Kamala’s open borders are destroying small towns,” and “Biden-Harris’ open border fuels migrant crime wave.”  CNN has reached out to Zuchowski’s office and the Harris campaign for comment.   Portage County is approximately 30 miles southeast of Cleveland. Zuchowski is also the president and chairman of the Ohio State Troopers Association and has served in public office for almost 30 years, according to his biography on the Portage County Sheriff’s Office website.   The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Ohio appeared to respond to Zuchowski’s post on Monday.  “Sheriffs are elected officials who have a duty to serve ALL members of their community. They are sworn to protect the public from intimidation and oppression,” the ACLU of Ohio said on X. “For the sitting sheriff of Portage County to be engaging in the very type of behavior he’s meant to combat is despicable.”   Former President Donald Trump on Monday said he needed more people on his security detail and suggested he told that to President Joe Biden when the president called him after the apparent assassination attempt Sunday. The White House said the two men had a “cordial conversation.” Biden conveyed his relief that Trump was safe, and the former president expressed his thanks for the call, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons wrote on X. Earlier, Trump sought to blame Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the apparent attempt on his life, saying that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that “they are the real threat.”  Former President Donald Trump explained his embrace of cryptocurrency on Monday, insisting that growing the industry in the United States would help the country compete with China. The comments are similar to some he made in July, when he promised to make it easier for cryptocurrency mining companies to operate in the US at a bitcoin conference. Since Trump announced his support for cryptocurrency earlier this year, industry leaders and investors have donated millions of dollars to his campaign and aligned political committees. While cryptocurrency “suffers from some credibility lapses,” Trump said the industry “has a chance to really be something special.” Pointing at the Biden administration’s efforts to regulate cryptocurrency, he suggested that some figures in the industry supposedly being investigated now would face consequences if he lost the election in November. Former President Donald Trump on Monday raised questions about the first assassination attempt against him in July and claimed there were “a couple of pretty strange things going on there.” His comments followed the apparent assassination attempt against Trump as he was golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Last week, former first lady Melania Trump also raised questions about the assassination attempt in Butler, claiming there was “more to the story.” Donald Trump praised the civilian who spotted and reported the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt against as the man was trying to flee the scene near the former president’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday. The civilian’s flag ultimately helped law enforcement officials locate the suspect’s vehicle driving north on I-95 in Martin County, one county to the north of Palm Beach. He also commended local law enforcement and the Secret Service. “They got him with a high-speed chase. … It was amazing. So Secret Service did a great job. And I think I can say honestly, the sheriff’s office, law enforcement, everybody really did a great job. Quite happy about that,” Trump added. More context on the civilian’s report: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said during a Sunday news conference that they were able to catch the suspect because a witness “came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great.” Former President Donald Trump on Monday publicly recounted the apparent assassination attempt in detail for the first time, recalling in a livestreamed discussion on X that he was playing with some of his friends when he heard gunshots. “It was quite something, but it worked out well, and Secret Service did an excellent job, and they have the man behind bars, and hopefully there for a long time,” Trump told cryptocurrency personality Farokh Sarmad. Trump recounted how a Secret Service agent saw the barrel of the suspect’s gun through the bushes. “He started shooting at the barrel, started shooting in the bushes. Could only see the barrel. … Based on that, he started shooting and ran toward the target and was shooting a lot, I mean, those were the shots we heard. The other one never got a shot off,” Trump said. The incident happened about 1:30 p.m. ET Sunday after a Secret Service agent noticed the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence between the fifth and sixth hole of Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, Florida, in a tree line near a heavily traveled road. This post has been updated with additional remarks from Donald Trump. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said the “big difference” between conservatives and liberals is that “no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris” in the past couple of months and now two people have tried to kill Donald Trump — which he sees as “strong evidence” that Democrats need to “tone down the rhetoric.” At the same time, Vance promised to do his part to tone down the rhetoric. He was speaking particularly to those who say Trump needs to be “eliminated,” referring to New York Rep. Dan Goldman, who said in an interview last year that Trump “has to be eliminated.” Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she reacted with “horror” to the news of a second apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. Vice presidential nominee JD Vance said he was with his 7-year-old son when he got a phone call from former President Donald Trump about 10 minutes after the apparent assassination attempt on Sunday. Vance said Trump told him he was “doing fine,” but said the former president was “a little mad” because he “was about to make a birdie.”  The weapon, according to authorities, was a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope. This post was updated with the description of the weapon provided by authorities. The Secret Service said it has seen Elon Musk’s deleted post about the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The post raised the question of why President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had not been targeted. Musk later posted several times that it had been a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. A spokesperson for the Secret Service declined to comment directly on the post but said the agency investigates all threats to the president and vice president. Some background: Musk initially resisted calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But the X owner was ultimately persuaded by a post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. However, Musk subsequently responded to a similar post, replying with a thinking face emoji to a photo that noted the four presidents who preceded Trump faced no assassination attempts when Trump has apparently encountered two. X did not respond to a request for comment. The White House called Musk’s comments “irresponsible.” The suspect in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was “nonplussed” when he was taken into custody, according to Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect, seemed alert but “never asked, ‘Well, what is this about?’” said Snyder, who was there when Routh was detained. His relaxed demeanor contrasted with the chaos of the moment, according to the sheriff. Routh remained calm even as he was surrounded by armed deputies with K-9 units and a helicopter overhead. A witness who happened to take a picture of Routh’s car and license plate as he allegedly fled the golf course after being shot at by the Secret Service was “crucial” to apprehending the suspect, Snyder said. Within 15 minutes, a road deputy had spotted the car based on the witness’ photo. Authorities flew the witness in a helicopter to the site to help identify Routh, according to Snyder. The post was updated with more details from the sheriff’s interview. Sen. Lindsey Graham was incredulous Monday that a man with a gun was able to get close to Donald Trump at his golf course Sunday during an apparent assassination attempt. Graham, a Trump ally and top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was asked if the Secret Service did its job in protecting Trump.   “I would say the guy did. But how can you say the system worked when a guy was able to get an AK-47 by the fence in a bunch of bushes and it’s just fortuitous the guy stuck the barrel out so the guy could see it,” he told reporters adding that Trump should continue playing golf despite what happened. The weapon, according to authorities, was a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell opened his remarks on the Senate floor Monday by expressing gratitude that Trump is safe and demanded assurances the former president is receiving the appropriate level of security. This post was updated with the description of the weapon provided by authorities. Law enforcement officials are working to learn more about the suspect in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump over the weekend. Meanwhile, the acting Director of the Secret Service Ronald Rowe Jr. on Monday defended the level of security provided for the former president, as the second apparent assassination attempt raised new questions about whether the Secret Service can adequately protect Trump. What we know about what happened: Where the investigation stands: Charges announced today:  Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden worked to shore up support among key constituencies during separate events Monday, an example of their strategic attempt to divide and conquer the campaign trail with the race to November heating up. In battleground Pennsylvania, a must-win state for Harris, Biden spoke to a Philadelphia conference attended by leaders of historically Black colleges and universities. For the fourth time in a week, his official remarks began with a nod to his onetime running mate. “I want to get to something straight at the outset,” Biden told the audience. “I love Kamala!” Harris, meanwhile, met with a key Democratic constituency behind closed doors: union members. The vice president held a roundtable discussion with rank-and-file members of the influential Teamsters union, whose leadership has been withholding an endorsement before learning more specifics on each candidates’ platform for organized labor. The divided ground game by the vice president and her boss-turned-surrogate, aides say, is all part of a plan. “We’ve got to be everywhere, blocking and tackling,” one Harris aide told CNN. Biden and Harris have appeared in an official capacity together at least four times since she’s ascended to the top of the ticket, but only once have they been side by side in a campaign capacity. Advisers say this is likely to be an increasingly rare occurrence going forward.  Read more here After holding roundtables with all three presidential candidates this cycle, the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters could reach an endorsement decision as soon as Wednesday, a spokesperson told CNN. Most major unions have already endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, including the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO. The Teamsters, with 1.3 million members across a variety of industries, is the largest union whose decision is still outstanding. Sean O’Brien, the union’s president, raised eyebrows after speaking at the Republican National Convention. O’Brien, the union said, requested speaking slots at both parties’ nominating conventions, and only the Republicans agreed. Instead, Harris met with Teamsters members during the Democratic convention. Later in the summer, O’Brien panned former President Donald Trump’s comments suggesting striking workers could be fired. O’Brien will now discuss the candidates with the group’s executive board, which will also consider the results of internal polling data. When Biden was still the Democratic nominee, sources had suggested the union could remain neutral in the election for the first time in three decades. Trump participated in a Teamsters roundtable in late January. Harris attended a rank-and-file roundtable with the Teamsters Monday in Washington, DC. Her campaign voiced fresh commitment to a slate of pro-union issues following the meeting.  A former police sergeant in Greensboro, North Carolina, said Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, had been well known to her department.  In an interview with CNN, Tracy Fulk, who said she retired in 2017, recalled receiving “several alerts” years earlier in the form of internal law enforcement reports related to Routh. “They would send out alerts saying, ‘Hey this person might be dangerous,’ and we had gotten several reports on Ryan Routh so I knew who he was,” Fulk said.   Fulk recalled a 2002 incident in which she stopped Routh because she saw him driving but knew his license had been revoked. Fulk said that as she approached his vehicle, Routh opened a duffle bag containing a firearm, prompting her to draw her weapon.   He then fled the scene and barricaded himself in his nearby business, which led to a stand-off with a police special-response team, Fulk said. He was later arrested.  Court records show that in 2002 Routh was charged with and later pleaded guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges including resisting an officer, carrying a concealed weapon, and ID card fraud. Fulk is listed on a court record as a charging officer. The barricade incident was previously described in a 2002 article in the Greensboro News & Record. President Joe Biden spoke with former President Donald Trump on Monday afternoon, and the two men had a “cordial conversation,” White House spokesperson Emilie Simons wrote on X. Biden conveyed his relief that Trump was safe, and the former president expressed his thanks for the call, Simons said. “We had a very nice call. It was about Secret Service protection,” Trump said in a statement provided to CNN. The conversation marked the pair’s second call in two months, after they spoke following the July assassination attempt on Trump. The man suspected of trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump on Sunday depicted himself on social media as a globe-trotting freedom fighter – tweeting at world leaders, traveling to Ukraine to support its war effort, and professing his willingness to die for the causes he believed in. In the years before Routh’s alleged assassination attempt, he posted messages online criticizing Trump and showed a deep interest in supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia. Routh joined X, then known as Twitter, in January 2020, and immediately began posting about politics, according to tweets saved by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Routh claimed in a 2020 post that he supported Trump in 2016, but had changed his tune on the former president – writing that “I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment (sic) and it seems you are getting worse and devolving.” More recently, he suggested that Trump’s campaign slogan should be “make Americans slaves again.” Routh also displayed a sense of self-importance in messages to world leaders as early as 2020, when he tweeted repeatedly at North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Read more about Routh’s history and behavior here. Federal Election Commission records show that Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, made a series of small-dollar contributions to several Democratic presidential candidates during the 2020 election cycle. The records show that Routh made 19 contributions between September 2019 and March 2020, ranging from between $1 and $25. Candidates who Routh gave to include Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke and Tom Steyer. Routh’s largest contribution was his first, on September 15, 2019, when he gave $25 to O’Rourke’s presidential campaign. Gabbard was the last candidate to receive a contribution from Routh, when he gave $3 on March 16, 2020. There are no contributions since the 2020 cycle, according to the records. President Joe Biden called Donald Trump in the last hour following Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on the former president, but the two did not connect, a senior White House official confirmed. Biden appeared to tell reporters when he arrived at the White House late Monday afternoon that he called Trump but the former president was unavailable. The official confirmed that’s what Biden was saying to reporters. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe commended agents for their actions Sunday but said that more support and resources are needed for the agency to be at its best. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw also voiced his support for the Secret Service, noting that Trump had told him that he feels safe. Hear from the Acting Secret Service Director here: The suspect in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump “didn’t even get close to getting a round off,” the sheriff said. A Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of the fence while Trump was playing golf at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday and “immediately engaged” with the person, Bradshaw had said previously. The person fled the scene in a car and was spotted by a witness. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office later pulled over the vehicle and detained the person. The witness was able to then identify the man. The FBI is “still exploring” whether Ryan Wesley Routh, the man suspected of staging an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, acted alone. “Our investigation will determine that,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office at a Monday news conference. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said former President Donald Trump called him Sunday night and “thanked me for everything that we did along with the Secret Service.” The acting director of the Secret Service argued that “there’s not much difference” in security at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate between now and 2017, when the former president was in office. Ronald Rowe Jr. said Monday there is a “heavy uniformed presence” and “additional assets of the Secret Service” around the Florida property. “When you look at that footprint” when Trump was in office “and you look at it today, there’s not much difference there. There is heavy uniformed presence out there,” Rowe said. He emphasized that Trump’s round of golf on Sunday was not on his official schedule, referring to it as an “off-the-record movement.” “We put together a security plan, and that security plan worked,” Rowe said. Following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump on July 13, “the Secret Service moved to increase assets to an already enhanced security posture for the former president,” Ronald Rowe Jr., acting director of the US Secret Service, said Monday at a news briefing. Suspect Ryan Wesley Routh did not have a line of sight of former President Donald Trump when he was caught by agents Sunday, Secret Service acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr. said. Routh was on the public side of the golf course fence, Rowe said at a Monday news conference. Rowe continued, “The subject who did not have line of sight to the former president fled the scene. He did not fire or get off any shots at our agents.” Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office said the agency is viewing the apparent attempted assassination of Donald Trump as “extremely serious.” The agency is “determined to provide answers as to what led up to the events which took place,” said Veltri. The FBI is working with its partners to pursue search warrants for Ryan Wesley Routh’s vehicle, cell phone and other devices, Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office said. The FBI’s investigative team, along with the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, “are actively working hand-in-hand to pursue and subsequently execute search warrants. Thus far, the warrants include a video recording device, subject’s cellular devices, a vehicle and other electronic devices located at previously known addresses,” Veltri said at a news conference Monday. The man suspected in an apparent assassination of Donald Trump had an “active online presence,” Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri said Monday. Veltri, who is from the FBI Miami Field Office, said the agency is going through all of the suspect’s posts and online search history. Some background: The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, had criticized Trump on social media and is a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Routh’s cell phone data indicates he may have spent nearly 12 hours near the area where he was spotted in the bushes, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. Markenzy Lapointe, US attorney, for the Southern District of Florida detailed allegations in the criminal complaint against Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump. The US attorney also shared the contents found in the area after Routh fled, according to the complaint: The FBI has already conducted interviews with witnesses at the scene of the apparent attempted assassination Sunday of former President Donald Trump, an official said Monday. Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office said it interviewed “seven civilian witnesses at the scene.” “And that is just the beginning,” Veltri said at a news conference. He said the FBI’s Honolulu, Hawaii, and Charlotte, North Carolina, field offices are also working to interview “several family members, frields and former colleagues of the subject.” Security at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida is the “highest it can possibly be” after the apparent attempted assassination of the former president over the weekend, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Monday. Bradshaw and other officials are giving an update on the investigation into the incident. The sheriff also said he will give “every possible resource” to the Secret Service as the investigation continues. The second apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump in as many months is raising new alarms about whether the Secret Service can adequately protect the former president or whether more needs to be done to bolster the security of the Republican presidential candidate even though he’s not in office. While Secret Service agents on Sunday prevented the potential shooter from firing at Trump while golfing at his West Palm Beach course – unlike the would-be assassin in Butler, Pennsylvania – questions are again swirling about how another gunman was able to get within several hundred yards of the former president. “He’s a former president running for reelection again. We have to be able to keep him safe,” Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat and member of the congressional task force now investigating both assassination attempts, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Sunday. While a sitting president is always afforded a different level of protection than candidates seeking the same office, a variety of credible threats against Trump and the first unsuccessful assassination attempt prompted the Secret Service to provide him with additional resources not usually offered to someone in his position. But after a second close call, even President Joe Biden recognized a problem still persists. “The Secret Service needs more help,” Biden told reporters while leaving the White House on Monday. Success in preventing the would-be gunman from firing any shots is being overshadowed by renewed questions about whether the Secret Service lacks the manpower, funding or operational flexibility to consistently protect the former president, particularly in similar outdoor settings, even as the agency’s budget has increased in the past decade. Read more here Donald Trump on Monday will unveil a new cryptocurrency business during an evening address from his Mar-a-Lago estate, the latest venture that stands to benefit the former president as he seeks another four years in the Oval Office. Details on the new business, which will be called World Liberty Financial, are limited, but Trump’s sons have spent weeks promoting it. The GOP nominee himself has teased the latest expansion of his family’s business empire from the same social media account that carries his political messaging. No major party nominee has ever leveraged their candidacy for personal profit quite like Trump has during his third White House bid. Since entering the race nearly two years ago, Trump has netted millions of dollars selling new items featuring moments from his political life while also generating billions of dollars in wealth through a social media site where he speaks directly to supporters. His fans can buy coffee table books featuring pictures and letters from his presidency or, if they prefer, a Trump-themed Bible. He has sold $399 golden sneakers and recently advertised to supporters “fifty all new stunning digital trading cards” for purchase at a cost of $99 each. Buy 75 and get access to a dinner gala with Trump, plus pieces of a suit he wore in his debate against President Joe Biden. But this latest enterprise, taking off just 50 days before the election, comes with a hornets nest of ethical conflicts should Trump win in November. On the campaign trail, the former president has promised to usher in a wave of policies favorable to digital currencies as he courted the votes and financial support of the bitcoin community. Now, a company he is helping to get off the ground could stand to benefit from the actions he takes in the Oval Office. Read more details about the potential conflicts here Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz on Monday said “violence has no place” in the United States and that she’s grateful Donald Trump is safe following yesterday’s second apparent assassination attempt against the former president.  Some background: Vice President Kamala Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and President Joe Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Former President Donald Trump spent the hours after the apparent assassination attempt in Florida talking to allies and advisers on the phone, including while he was in lockdown at Trump International Golf Course. Multiple sources that spoke to the former president said that Trump seemed to be in good spirits.  The circumstances around Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt, including Trump being quickly rushed to safety and place under lockdown, enabled the former president’s team to be briefed far faster than they were after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, where some staff was left in limbo about Trump’s overall state for hours. While some close to Trump said that they were initially startled by the news that there had been shots fired near the former president, they were also told immediately that Trump was safe and in a secure location. The Secret Service quickly briefed members of the campaign on what had transpired while Trump was still in lockdown, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened his remarks on the Senate floor today by praising the Secret Service’s quick action yesterday during the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, and indicated that the Secret Service could receive more resources as government funding negotiations continue. “I will say what I have said many times before: there is no place in America for political violence of any kind. I’m glad the former president is safe, and I applaud the Secret Service and all first responders for acting quickly before anyone got hurt. As for the perpetrator, he should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” said Schumer. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell condemned violence against Donald Trump after a second apparent assassination attempt against the former president, while also saying the GOP presidential nominee is “contributing” to the charged environment with his rhetoric and that she fears a “civil war” would break out if something happened to Trump. Referencing the second assassination attempt, Dingell said that “this violence has to stop, but we also need to understand who and what he is and how much he is contributing to it,” adding, “he has not said he’ll accept the election results.” Dingell said Trump “will not condemn some of the violence we’ve been seeing,” and pointed to Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance “defending his lying” by continuing to promote false stories about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.  Asked to support his claims about immigrants eating pets by CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening, though he still didn’t provide the evidence. He also denied that his rhetoric was contributing to danger in the communtity, as city hall and schools in Springfield have experienced threats. Dingell said what Vance has done is “not OK,” and “that’s what we have to remind people of. That’s who these people are. I don’t want to go back to that.” As the Secret Service grapples with another apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, the former president’s schedule could present another challenge for them — a highly anticipated college football game. According to four sources familiar with the matter, Trump is scheduled to travel to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on September 28, for the Alabama-Georgia game. Trump previously attended a game in the state when he was in office, but this would be his first time with a robust, but smaller, security presence than he had when he was the sitting president.   The stadium seats more than 100,000 people, and officials at the university were already planning about how to accommodate Trump, his staff and his detail. Trump sat in a box the last time he was in Tuscaloosa and is expected to do so again, a source told CNN.  The trip is still moving forward, but it remains to be seen whether the second shooting alters his plans. There has already been a noticeable change around Trump since the first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. He now has a ramped-up security presence and at times speaks behind ballistic glass when out in public. Former President Donald Trump on Monday told followers on X to “join me live from Mar-a-Lago” on X Spaces at 8 p.m. ET.  Trump had been scheduled to launch a new cryptocurrency business called World Liberty Financial at 8 p.m. on X Spaces. Trump’s post suggests the launch is moving forward as planned despite the assassination attempt that took place at Trump International Golf Club the day prior. One of the two federal gun laws Ryan Wesley Routh has been charged with has come under judicial scrutiny in recent years as courts have reexamined the nation’s gun laws in light of a 2022 landmark Supreme Court decision expanding Second Amendment rights. Routh, the suspect of an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday, was charged Monday with possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number and possession of a firearm while a convicted felon.   The constitutionality of the federal law underpinning the second charge has been examined by federal courts around the country in recent years after some people convicted under it or subject to its prohibition have tried to take it off the books.   Courts have been divided on whether it is constitutionally sound. In one case, a Philadelphia-based federal appeals court that had initially said the law was constitutional as applied to a man convicted of welfare fraud said that the federal law violates the Second Amendment. It cited the 2022 Supreme Court decision, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, that said firearm laws must be rooted in historical tradition. But other federal courts have upheld the prohibition, including in cases concerning people convicted of violent and non-violent felonies.   The Supreme Court was asked this year to settle the question for good, with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar saying in court papers that disagreement among lower courts about the law’s constitutionality “is undermining public safety.”  This June, the Supreme Court said that some types of regulations can withstand the strict test it created two years ago. The Supreme Court has now asked lower courts to look at cases involving the felon disarmament law with that revised structure in mind. When there were rumors of a plot against the life of Abraham Lincoln before his 1861 inauguration, there was no official protection for the president-elect. Southern states were seceding from the Union in protest of Lincoln’s election, and the rumored plot out of Baltimore led Lincoln, at the urging of the private detective Allan Pinkerton, to sneak into Washington, DC, disguised on a late-night train. During his presidency, Lincoln eschewed bodyguards despite threats. The night Lincoln was shot at Ford’s Theatre the following year, his lone guard was at a saloon next door. But incredibly, it was on the day Lincoln was shot that the president had signed legislation creating what is today the US Secret Service. However, the agency was commissioned within the Treasury Department, and the Secret Service was entirely focused on counterfeit money. The Secret Service didn’t start protecting presidents until 1894, and only part time, after agents probing a group of gamblers discovered an assassination plot aimed at then-President Grover Cleveland. Two more presidents — James Garfield in 1881 and William McKinley in 1901 — would be killed before Congress officially tasked the Secret Service with protecting US presidents full time. McKinley’s successor, Theodore Roosevelt, was the first president to get round-the-clock protection, but only two agents were assigned full time to the detail. What was once just two full-time agents assigned to protect Roosevelt in 1902 has now grown to a force of thousands under the Department of Homeland Security. The entire Secret Service employs nearly 8,000 people, and it secures thousands of events each year. In fiscal year 2023, it guarded 33 “protectees.” Read more here President Joe Biden decried Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and condemned political violence in remarks from Philadelphia on Monday. Biden, speaking at the National HBCU Week Conference, commended the Secret Service for its “expert handling” of the situation and said the acting head of the agency, Ronald Rowe, is in Florida “determining whether any further adjustments need to be made to ensure the safety of our former president.” The president added that assassination “solves nothing. It just tears the country apart. We must do everything we can to prevent it and never give it any oxygen.” Attorney General Merrick Garland promised in a Monday statement to use “every available resource” in the investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump. Garland said that “the FBI is continuing to investigate what appears to be an assassination attempt of former President Trump” and that “we are grateful that the former President is safe.” Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, has an extensive criminal history in North Carolina, records show.  In 2002, he was charged with and later pleaded guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges, including resisting an officer, carrying a concealed weapon and ID card fraud.  Those are the most serious charges he faced, but the records also show a litany of less serious accusations as well — some of which were dismissed. He has faced multiple charges related to worthless checks in separate cases. While some cases were dismissed, he pleaded guilty to one such charge in 2003.  In 2009, he was charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. The case was dismissed.  In 2010, he was found guilty of misdemeanor possession of stolen goods and received three years of probation. That same year, he was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, though a court docket states the case was dismissed.  He has faced various other charges related to traffic issues. For example, in 1996, he pleaded guilty to driving with no registration. Separately, state and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. He faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records. The Pennsylvania State Police provided the bipartisan congressional task force investigating the July assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump with the documents it requested due Monday, a source familiar with the process told CNN.  “They were responsive to our request,” the source added.  The request included a slew of documents and information from the Pennsylvania State Police, including transcripts of interviews, body-camera footage and radio communications.   The task force also requested internal communications and other information related to the July 13 event in Butler, Pennsylvania. Some background: The task force, made up of six Democrats and seven Republicans, was approved by the House in July in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, but the appointment came at a fraught political time as members work to prove to both parties that they’re thoroughly investigating the attempted assassination. The 13 lawmakers have until mid-December to issue a final report and recommendations in the investigation. Members of the task force promised last month to get to the bottom of the security failures even if it may be a “slow process,” after the group toured the Pennsylvania rally site where the shooting took place. The FBI is investigating what it said is an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump at his Florida golf club Sunday, the second time in two months there has been an apparent attempt on the former president’s life. Trump is safe and was not harmed in the incident, his campaign said. Federal and local law enforcement are expected to provide updates on the investigation at a news briefing later today. Here’s where things stand now: Former President Donald Trump on Monday continued to try to blame Vice President Kamala Harris’ rhetoric for the apparent assassination attempt at his golf club on Sunday. In a new post on social media, the former president pointed to Harris’ statements during the ABC presidential debate, without specifying which ones.  “The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe’s, then Kamala’s, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust. Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Trump has repeatedly claimed the debate last week was “rigged” against him and has bashed the debate moderators and said he will not participate in another debate before the election. He also continues to baselessly claim that the criminal charges he faces and his felony conviction were masterminded by President Joe Biden and Harris because Trump is running for president.  In his first interview after the apparent assassination attempt in West Palm Beach posted earlier on Monday, Trump also sought to blame Biden and Harris for the apparent attempt on his life and argued in his first interview since the incident that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.”   Authorities recovered an SKS-style rifle with a scope from the area Ryan Wesley Routh fled Sunday after he was spotted by a Secret Service agent, according to newly unsealed court documents.  An affidavit from Mark A. Thomas, an FBI special agent, said Secret Service agents recovered a “loaded SKS-style 7.62x39 caliber rifle with a scope,” as well as a digital camera and two bags, including a backpack. The affidavit included a black-and-white photo of the items law enforcement found. Routh was charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.  He could face years in prison if convicted of the two charges, according to court documents. The felon in possession of a firearm charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and three years of supervised release, while the possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number carries a maximum of five years in prison and three years of supervised release. Officials from the Secret Service, the FBI and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office will hold a public briefing at 4 p.m. ET to provide updates on the investigation into Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. The briefing will take place near the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump tried to bring people over to fight in Ukraine via non-official means, against the advice of the International Legion in the country, and had “delusions of grandeur,” according to a former recruiter for the military unit. Evelyn Aschenbrenner, an American citizen who served for two years in the International Legion in Ukraine, a military unit of the Ukrainian Ground Forces that is composed of foreign volunteers, told CNN they warned Ryan Wesley Routh several times to use official routes to recruit people to fight in Ukraine and bring them across the border — but he just wouldn’t listen. Aschenbrenner, who identifies as gender fluid and uses “they/them” pronouns, worked as an administrator and then in an official recruiting role within the International Legion. “In August 2022, Routh put my phone number and another recruiter’s phone number on a website that he had designed. I got angry. I told him, ‘Take this down. You didn’t get our permission. The legion already has a recruiting website, there’s no need for you to be doing this. There’s already enough disinformation about Ukraine. Don’t start adding to it,’” Aschenbrenner said. Instead, Routh kept trying to bring people over the border into Ukraine, Aschenbrenner said. “In August 2022, for Ukraine’s Independence Day, there was a high security risk, with curfews in place in Kharkiv and other cities. And Routh messaged me asking to get some random person over the border and he sent me this poor woman’s passport,” they said. Aschenbrenner replied to Routh, saying they had no authority to bring people over, and highlighted the strike alert all over the country. “It’s a military. There’s a chain of command,” Aschenbrenner said they told Routh. “You need to be okay with possible delays. It’s an active war zone.” But Aschenbrenner said Routh got mad about that and replied to them in a message, which was seen by CNN: “I’ll tell the world Ukraine does not want help…it is obvious.” Aschenbrenner said they never saw Routh in Ukraine, neither in a combat zone nor in a military base.  “He seemed to have this delusion of grandeur thing, where he was the … I’ve seen this with some other volunteers on smaller scales … they’re the only one really helping Ukraine,” Aschenbrenner said. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office released bodycam video of the apprehension of Ryan Wesley Routh on Sunday on an interstate in Florida. Routh, who is suspected of planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf on Sunday, was stopped on the highway after authorities say a Secret Service agent engaged a suspect near Trump’s golf club after noticing the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. Bradshaw said a witness saw a man run from the bushes. Routh was later detained in Martin County, about an hour drive from Trump’s golf club. See video of the moment: CNN’s Evan Perez, Holmes Lybrand, Michael Williams and Devan Cole contributed reporting to this post. In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number on the rifle recovered from the area where Ryan Wesley Routh was spotted at Trump’s golf club was “unreadable to the naked eye.”   One of the charges Routh is facing has to do with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number — meaning that when law enforcement recovered the weapon Sunday, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump, made his initial court appearance Monday morning at a federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida. Court sketches show Routh standing before the judge. Ryan Wesley Routh’s cell phone data indicates he may have spent nearly 12 hours on Sunday near the area where he was spotted in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. An FBI agent said in affidavit filed in court that during their initial investigation, law enforcement got phone records from T-Mobile that indicated Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the area” where he was first spotted by US Secret Service from around 1:59 am local time Sunday until 1:31 pm local time, when a USSS agent saw his rifle poking out from a tree line. The court document also details Routh’s past run-ins with the law, including felony convictions in North Carolina. He was convicted in 2002 for “possession of a weapon of mass death and destruction,” and he was convicted in 2010 for “multiple counts of possession of stolen goods.” Federal law prohibits individuals convicted of a felony from possessing firearms. The arrest of the Trump attempted assassination suspect Sunday was a “textbook case of a traffic stop of a known felon,” Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said Monday at a news conference. At about 1:55 p.m. Sunday, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office got a BOLO – or “be on the lookout” alert – about a suspect in the case heading north on I-95, with a vehicle description and a tag number. Every available unit – about 30 in all, he estimated – went out to search. One patrol deputy saw the suspect vehicle at about Mile Marker 110 and alerted others but did not immediately try to stop the vehicle, Snyder said. Instead, the deputy waited for two large F-250 pickup trucks to get in place on the highway. Those trucks surrounded the vehicle, he continued, and forced it to a stop at about Mile Marker 112. Officers then did a “felony stop,” calling the suspect out of the vehicle. He came back and was handcuffed, the sheriff said. They turned the suspect and his vehicle over to the FBI. Snyder praised his team for following procedures designed to avoid a high-speed chase or a shootout. The sheriff also praised the witness who told authorities he had seen a suspect flee the golf course and get into a Nissan. “That witness deserves a lot of credit,” Snyder said. A criminal complaint against Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, was unsealed shortly before noon ET Monday after he made his initial court appearance where federal prosecutors charged him with gun-related charges.  An affidavit in the court file details what unfolded Sunday at Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida where a US Secret Service agent thwarted an apparent assassination attempt. Read the full criminal complaint below: Former President Donald Trump is still planning on attending his previously scheduled campaign events this week following the apparent assassination attempt, two sources familiar with the schedule tell CNN. The schedule: Trump’s virtual address on cryptocurrency on Monday evening will continue as planned. Trump is expected be in Flint, Michigan, tomorrow, Uniondale, New York, on Wednesday and Washington, DC, this week. One of the charges Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, is facing involves possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. That means when law enforcement recovered Routh’s weapon, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. It’s a common charge you see with drug and gang suspects. Most times people don’t manage to obliterate the serial numbers in every place it is imprinted on the gun. They can do the ones readily visible but not others in harder-to-reach places.  In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number was “unreadable to the naked eye.”  So far, Routh has been charged with two firearm counts. Dave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach, Florida, said Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, will face federal, not state charges.  Aronberg told MSNBC that Florida initially considered pursuing state charges, but stood down when federal agents took over the case. It may be difficult to charge Routh with a crime against Trump specifically. Aronberg said the distance between Routh and Trump, between 300 to 500 yards, might be too far for the court to be certain Routh was aiming his rifle at Trump. Instead, Aronberg said it will be much easier to charge Routh with aiming at the Secret Service agent who saw the rifle barrel pointed at him. When asked about the possibility of an insanity argument, Aronberg said it would be very difficult to argue insanity in this case because Routh fled the scene, showing he was aware his actions were wrong. Aronberg told MSNBC the evidence left behind including the two bags, ceramic tiles, GoPro, AK-14 rifle and scope will be key in making the case against Routh for attempted murder. The 2024 presidential election is less than 50 days away and the campaigns and their allies are continuing to blitz battleground states with tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advertising, Pennsylvania looming largest. Since July 22, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out to September 16, the top seven battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada — have seen $688.7 million in combined presidential advertising. During that stretch, Democrats lead Republicans — including campaigns and outside groups — by about $369.3 million to $315.3 million. Here are the latest numbers by broken down by state:  Pennsylvania Michigan Georgia Wisconsin Arizona North Carolina Nevada Pennsylvania remains the premier battleground, accounting for about $185.3 million in total ad spending since Biden dropped out, and Democrats are beginning to open a meaningful edge there after weeks in which the parties have been running close. As of today, Democrats have spent about $100 million on presidential ads in Pennsylvania, compared to about $84.3 million for Republicans. Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to blame President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the apparent attempt on his life at his Florida golf club. During an interview with Fox News Digital the former president said that the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.” Trump added, “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.”   The former president pointed to comments made by Biden and Harris that Trump is a threat to democracy, according to Fox News Digital, and said, “These are people that want to destroy our country.”   He said that Biden and Harris, “They are the real threat.” “They use highly inflammatory language,” Trump said. “I can use it too — far better than they can — but I don’t,” Trump said. Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden kicked off his 2024 campaign which he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power.” Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.” Trump frequently uses inflammatory rhetoric when attacking his political rivals, judges overseeing his criminal cases, prosecutors who have brought charges against him, undocumented immigrants, people who don’t support his campaign and others. Trump has vowed retribution if he is reelected and has repeatedly suggested he would weaponize the justice system to prosecute his political opponents. Trump also recently threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Donald Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought against Ryan Wesley Routh, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors are seeking to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate what the FBI has said appears to be an attempted assassination. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he has not yet spoken with former President Donald Trump after what appeared to be an attempted assassination on him as he played golf on Sunday, but reiterated that his state was doing its own investigation as “there is a need to make sure that the truth about all of this comes out in a way that is credible.” While taking questions, DeSantis explained his reasoning for why Florida was doing its own, separate investigation to the federal one. DeSantis said more details about the investigation would be announced in the coming days. He first announced the investigation on Sunday on X. DeSantis made the comments at a news conference in Orlando, Florida, where he appeared alongside education leaders in the state. During Monday’s hearing in federal court in Florida, Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect behind the apparent assassination attempt, answered the judge’s questions with nods and “yes judge” responses. The judge found Routh couldn’t afford his own attorney after he said he had “zero funds” in savings. He was making $3,000 a month before his arrest, Routh told the judge, but had no assets beyond two trucks in Hawaii. Prosecutor Adam McMichael said they would be asking for pre-trial detention, citing a risk of flight and danger to the community. Authorities suspect Routh, who owns a small construction company in Hawaii, was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf on Sunday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man suspected in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, has been charged with two firearm counts. The counts include possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.   A detention hearing has been set for September 23 and the arraignment is set for September 30. The White House weighed in on the now-deleted post from Elon Musk, calling the comment “irresponsible” and saying violence should be “never encouraged or joked about.” Musk deleted a post Monday morning questioning why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. Musk later claimed the post was a joke. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is holding a news conference in Orlando, Florida, a day after an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. DeSantis, who is speaking at an elementary school, addressed tertiary education across Florida and did not mention the incident involving Trump. Yesterday, the Florida governor announced on X that his state will conduct its own investigation of the incident. The apparent assassination attempt took place at Trump International Golf Club, which is located in West Palm Beach. CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed to this report. Kamala Harris’ campaign does not plan to address the weekend’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in a political manner, sources said, and any forthcoming remarks from the vice president on the developments are expected to closely mirror her statement released by the White House Sunday night. Both President Joe Biden and Harris were briefed on the incident in West Palm Beach, and both were quick to condemn all kinds of political violence and express relief that the former president was not harmed. Harris said in a statement — released in her official capacity as vice president via the White House — that she was “deeply disturbed” by the apparent assassination attempt. “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said. “I am thankful that former President Trump is safe.” Harris is participating in a meeting with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, this afternoon. She is also spending part of the day preparing for an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump,  is in federal court for an initial appearance Monday morning. Routh is wearing dark prison scrubs, and his feet and hands are shackled. He has been escorted to a holding area to await his appearance. Federal prosecutors have not yet announced what charges Routh will face. He was taken into custody Sunday after being stopped on the highway following the shooting incident. Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe is on the bench. Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe plans to remain in Florida “indefinitely” as the investigation into an apparent second assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump plays out, according to USSS spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.  Rowe will also meet with local law enforcement today and then do a walk through of the golf course this afternoon, Guglielmi told CNN on Monday.  He was appointed to the position on July 23, after Kimberly Cheatle resigned after Trump was shot in the ear in an attempted assassination. Trump and Rowe will meet today in Florida this afternoon, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this post. The man detained in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was so calm when he was stopped it was “perplexing,” the sheriff of Martin County, Florida, recalled.  “His facial affect was so flat. His demeanor was relaxed,” Sheriff William Snyder told CNN on Monday morning. “I honestly thought it looked like somebody that had just left the church picnic and was on his way home.” Despite the commotion surrounding his apprehension – the area “crawling with law enforcement … SWAT team (that) had gotten out their rifles, helicopter, I-95 shut down, a bomb dog” – the man never even asked why he got pulled over, Snyder said. The traffic stop unfolded after the sheriff’s office got a BOLO – a “be on the lookout” alert – with a vehicle and tag description, Snyder said. A road patrol deputy spotted the vehicle, followed it for a couple miles and waited for big trucks with heavy bumpers to get there and force the vehicle to a stop, he said. Deputies then conducted a felony stop and safely brought the man out of the vehicle into custody, Snyder said. Ryan Wesley Routh is appearing in federal court Monday morning. Now, Snyder’s main concern is to investigate whether anyone else was involved, he said. “Are we tracking with a conspiracy?” he asked. “That’s the question that I think has to be answered.” As the investigation over the apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump continues, the 2024 presidential candidates are hitting the campaign trail this week to make their pitch to voters in the final sprint to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting key swing states this week, while Trump is holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Monday: Trump will introduce a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will deliver remarks at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual dinner. Harris, meanwhile, will attend a roundtable with the Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, as she seeks to win over support from organized labor. Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, while Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. President Joe Biden wants Congress to give the US Secret Service “more help” in the wake of the second apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, he told reporters Monday.  “Thank God the president is okay,” Biden said. Asked by CNN’s Kevin Liptak what kind of help they needed, Biden responded, “I think we need some more personnel.” Staffing issues have plagued the Secret Service for years. Agents and officers have described feeling burned out by overtime shifts and long assignments, leading to high turnover. Then-director Kim Cheatle told Congress over the summer that the agency currently has 8,000 employees but that its goal was to reach 9,500. The Secret Service faced significant scrutiny following the first assassination attempt against Trump when he was struck in the ear during a rally in July. Elon Musk deleted a post Monday morning that questioned why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. He later claimed the post was a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. Musk initially resisted numerous calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But Musk was ultimately persuaded by an X post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. “Fair enough. I don’t want to do what they have done, even in jest,” Musk responded. He later posted several times that the deleted post had been a joke. There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided the tragedy of seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speak to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: that those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. Read more about the impact the assassination could have here. Ryan Wesley Routh, the detained man behind Donald Trump’s second apparent assassination attempt, was a small business owner in Hawaii and avid supporter of the Ukrainian war effort. CNN spoke to another Hawaiian business owner and a journalist in Ukraine, both of whom had interacted with Routh in the past. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June 2022, where the American was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. According to Cernea, Routh described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “black and white… good versus evil” conflict. In an interview with the AFP news agency from Kyiv in April 2022, Routh said: “Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the globe to stop what they’re doing and come here now and support the Ukrainians to end this war.” In another instance, Hawaiian business owner Saili Levi told CNN he had paid Routh $3,800 upfront to build a trailer for his business. But when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy, he said. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man detained Sunday in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, was driving his daughter’s car when he was apprehended, according to a law enforcement source. Routh was detained after the Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence and agents fired at a man who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. He then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The person detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt Sunday on former President Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course did not fire any shots, the Palm Beach County sheriff said Monday morning. The man is detained at a “federal holding facility,” Bradshaw added. Asked whether he is talking, Bradshaw responded: “No.” Bradshaw also praised the quick action of the Secret Service for keeping the former president safe. “This is not like what happened in Butler,” he said, referring to the assassination attempt against Trump two months ago in Pennsylvania that sparked scrutiny of the Secret Service. A photo of the moment 58-year-old Ryan Routh was detained by police in Florida, after allegedly being caught with a rifle on a golf course where former President Donald Trump was playing has been released. The Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence on Sunday and agents fired at Routh, who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. It is believed he then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office shared the image with CNN on Monday. Golf courses, and in particular former President Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds, according to people familiar with the matter. While security around Trump was bolstered in the aftermath of the first attempt on his life over the summer, the new beefed-up protective detail wasn’t able to prevent another would-be assassin from coming within 500 yards of the former president, armed with an AK-47 with a telescopic sight on Sunday. In some ways, a similar issue led to both situations: difficulty securing a perimeter around the former president. A golf course presents a particular challenge. The fairways and greens of a golf course are often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements such as trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the former president as he plays and secures the areas before he arrives. Read the full story. Ryan Routh attended a demonstration in support of a Ukrainian National Guard brigade in Kyiv in 2022, according to images verified by CNN. But in an official statement, the 12th National Guard Azov Brigade told CNN: “He has nothing to do with our brigade.” Other Ukrainian military groupings have issued similar statements saying Routh was not involved with them despite him expressing interest in aiding Ukraine.  A representative from Ukraine’s Land Forces Command foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted it several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. The Ukrainian military’s International Legion of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, another foreign legion organization, also said Routh had “never served” and “has no relation to the unit.” Ryan Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf, was a staunch supporter of Ukraine and had visited the country. Routh’s time in Ukraine: In an April 2022 video by AFP in Kyiv, Routh called Putin a “terrorist” and said “he needs to be ended.” A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Routh also expressed support for Ukraine on social media. In dozens of posts on X in 2022, he said he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”  He used Facebook to encourage foreigners to fight in the war, trying to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government.   The FBI said it “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, just two months after an attempt to kill the Republican presidential nominee at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president was not harmed. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii, has been detained in connection with Sunday’s incident, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what happened: Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company, has been detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what we know about him: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday that a Secret Service agent was able to spot a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and that the agent “engaged” with the suspect. The gunman was 300 to 500 yards away from former President Donald Trump, a Secret Service official said. The former president was one or two holes behind because the security detail moves ahead to make sure the area is cleared. The agent noticed the rifle barrel sticking out during the advance check, the official said. “The US Secret Service personnel opened fire on a gunman located near the property line and this matter is under investigation,” the Secret Service representative said. A witness saw the suspect later detained in the security incident near former President Donald Trump run from the bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s apprehension, according to the Palm Beach County sheriff. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Sunday that his office was alerted at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the US Secret Service. “We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Bradshaw said. Authorities were able to get a hit on the vehicle and alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the suspect. The witness was able to then identify the man Law enforcement officials found a weapon and other items left behind by the suspect where he was positioned in the bushes near the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. “In the bushes, where this guy was, is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope; two backpacks, which were hung on the fence and had ceramic tile in them; and a GoPro. … So, those are being processed right now,” Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said."
New York City Mayor Eric Adams’s administration is in chaos as federal probes target his inner circle | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:22 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T10:45:41.284Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/eric-adams-new-york-mayor-chief-counsel/index.html,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams’s administration is unraveling. Late Saturday night, the mayor abruptly announced the resignation of his top lawyer and most ardent public defender. Days earlier, his police commissioner stepped down under pressure as a quartet of federal probes targeting numerous members of Adams’s inner circle hits a boil. The stunning departure of chief counsel Lisa Zornberg, a former federal prosecutor, opened up a new and troubling chapter in the political and legal crisis now gripping City Hall. “I am tendering my resignation, effective today,” Zornberg wrote in a short letter, “as I have concluded that I can no longer effectively serve in my position.” Adams in a statement thanked her and said he would name a temporary replacement in the coming days. “These are hard jobs and we don’t expect anyone to stay in them forever,” Adams added in a bid to downplay the remarkable nature of Zornberg’s decision. By Monday, at least three Democratic officeholders – progressives from the state assembly, Senate and city council – had called on Adams to resign. The mayor rejected the notion in a call with reporters and suggested his critics, particularly those who have sparred with him before, were politically motivated. “Any time anything happens in this city, and they call for me to leave, are we supposed to listen to them now?” Adams said. “I was elected by the people of this city and I am going to continue to meet my obligation to the people of this city.” Adams has been fending off allegations that corruption and malfeasance permeate the highest ranks of his administration for months, first stemming from an active federal investigation into corruption and illegal campaign donations linked to Turkey and foreign travel, according to a source familiar with the matter. Adams is now entering an already fraught 2025 re-election bid under the cloud of at least four separate federal investigations – a political and legal onslaught that New York Democrats broadly expect to ramp up in the coming weeks and months. Adams has not been accused of any wrongdoing and the administration has said it will cooperate with all investigations. Brian Blais, a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, spoke to CNN about the potential problems Adams could face. “If campaign finance related charges are brought, or FARA (foreign agent registration act) charges relating to acting as an agent of the Turkish government, or bribery charges to the extent he was taking favorable actions in exchange for those campaign contributions, those are all serious charges, and those carry significant consequences,” said Blais.
“There’s at least some real degree of legal peril for the mayor.” The growing probes – underscored by increasingly aggressive tactics from prosecutors, who stopped Adams on the street last year to seize his phone – also signal mounting political trouble for the retired police captain who outlasted a crowded field of Democrats in 2021 on his way to winning the city’s top job. Even before he was elected, Adams embraced the national media spotlight, declaring himself the “face of the new Democratic Party” and, after being invited to the White House, described himself as “the Biden of Brooklyn.” But the luster quickly faded. First with Biden, after Adams publicly criticized the president’s handling of the border and a migrant crisis that hit hard in New York. The mayor’s reputation for enjoying the nightlife – at the expense, Adams’s critics say, of his day job – and repeated clashes over city spending, especially on education, dimmed his political star. Adams’s political troubles, though, have been magnified and multiplied by the federal probes, which are picking up pace as the 2024 political season heats up. Investigators in the Southern District of New York have been circling Adams and his administration for nearly a year. Last November, the mayor’s chief fundraiser was raided by FBI agents. Days later, Adams himself was presented with a federal search warrant for his electronics. That remarkable escalation by federal prosecutor Damian Williams was followed by a period of relative quiet until earlier this month, when FBI officials issued search warrants and showed up at the homes of several Adams administration officials. The group included the city’s First Deputy Commissioner Sheena Wright, the Schools Chancellor David Banks and the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks III, according to multiple sources familiar with the probe. Investigators also issued a subpoena to Terence Banks, the youngest of the Banks’ brothers – who ran a lobbying firm that advertised “government relations” and promised to help private sector clients navigate “New York’s intricate infrastructure and political landscape.” Tim Pearson, a former NYPD officer and adviser to the mayor, was also included in the searches, sources briefed on the investigation say. None of the officials have been accused of any crime. Wright said in a briefing last week, “I’m confident that I have done nothing wrong,” and was “cooperating fully.” David Banks said in a statement he was “cooperating with a federal inquiry.” An attorney for Phil Banks said in a statement, “In my judgment I don’t believe he has any criminal liability in this investigation whatsoever.” An attorney for Terence Banks told CNN, “We have been assured by the Government that Mr. Banks is not a target of this investigation.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Pearson for further comment. US attorneys’ offices and the FBI have declined to comment. But the most shocking blow landed at One Police Plaza. NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, the leader of the largest and most expensive police force in the nation, had his phone seized along with several other police officials’ devices as part of an investigation into a nightclub security business run by his twin brother, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. He resigned under pressure days later, saying in a statement that “news around recent developments has created a distraction for our department.” Caban’s lawyers said on Thursday they’ve been informed he is not a target of any investigation and he expects to cooperate fully with the government. In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Adams’s top spokesperson touted the administration’s record on public safety and affordability, and suggested New Yorkers were not paying close attention to the investigations. “We are investing in the programs and initiatives that working-class New Yorkers care about – that’s what our city’s residents and our administration are focused on every day,” said Fabien Levy, the deputy mayor for communications. “No matter what is going on in our city, New Yorkers recognize that we are in a much better place today than we were 2.5 years ago.” While the spate of aggressive investigative maneuvers sent shockwaves through political and law enforcement circles, Adams has not been charged with any crime. That decision will ultimately come down to the discretion of Williams’s office, compounding the pressure on the prosecutor as he seeks to navigate a fraught moment – with the presidential election less than two months away. “If something is going to happen, if there are people in the mayor’s political orbit, or the mayor himself, who is going to be charged, I think that, in DOJ ‘s view, it likely needs to happen by March (2025),” said Blais, now a partner at the law firm Ropes and Gray. “So you’re talking about a six-to-seven month window left before any significant action is likely, or during which any significant action is likely to occur.” Other observers are predicting a shorter timeline at least in part because of the uncertainty surrounding this November’s election. Victory for former President Donald Trump, who would again take over the Justice Department, could upend Williams’s office. One former top aide to top prosecutors in New York told CNN that Williams, “a very thoughtful, considered guy,” is conscious of the stakes – both in this election cycle and the broader sweep of city history. “He’s aware of all the implications here,” the former aide said. “He’s aware that this is the second Black mayor. He’s aware that he’s a Black prosecutor. None of this is happening without that awareness, which to me makes it even more scary if I’m Eric Adams.” Williams on Monday, while announcing public corruption charges against two former fire department chiefs in what is believed to be an unrelated probe, demurred when asked what he would tell New Yorkers concerned over the City Hall investigations. “I am constrained on what I can say,” Williams told reporters. “I speak when there is something to be said and I don’t have anything to say about that at this point.” He did, however, offer a pointed message about his office’s work. “We are determined to address it from root to branch, and our work is far from done,” Williams said. “If you are aware of and participated in corrupt activity in our government, now is the time to come forward to get on the right side of the law.” For his part, the mayor has insisted that he never broke the law, nor knew of any of his friends and colleagues’ potential wrongdoing. During brief remarks to reporters after Caban stepped down, Adams insisted again that he was “surprised” by the breadth of probes and said he was taking “them extremely seriously.” “I’ve spent more than 20 years in law enforcement, and so every member of my administration knows my expectations that we must follow the law,” Adams said, repeating a variation on a message he’s given a handful of times now. This latest round of phone seizures and subpoenas have, as a political matter, all but guaranteed that Adams will face a robust set of Democratic primary challengers next year. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie of Brooklyn is expected to launch his bid soon. City Comptroller Brad Lander is already in, along with his predecessor, Scott Stringer, who also ran in 2021. Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, kicked off her campaign on Friday, less than a day after Caban resigned. Others, including state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani could still join the fray. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 with impeachment looming following the release of a report that found he sexually harassed 11 women, has also seeded rumors about a potential run. Cuomo has denied the allegations. Adams’s record as mayor, headlined by controversial budget cuts and what critics call a lack of a signature program or legislative achievement, always seemed bound to attract intra-party challengers. But the close-to-home nature of the federal probes appear – at least to some rival Democrats – to be a uniquely damaging development. “Crises are a problem when they bring up for an incumbent candidate things people were already feeling and double down on or amplify something that was already out there,” said Stringer adviser Alyssa Cass. Another veteran New York campaign strategist with experience in City Hall but no ties to this race and speaking anonymously because of the sensitive nature of the latest developments, warned that Adams’s challengers needed to carefully calibrate their messages. Their attacks, so far, have mostly focused on a perception of “chaos” in the administration and an argument that Adams is a weak manager. “Adams does not lose unless you start taking away some part of his coalition,” the strategist said. “And that is a working-class coalition. You don’t need to speak about who’s managing city operations, you need to talk about who’s getting you what you need, to (argue that) Adams has been compromised and is totally beholden to these shady special interests. And it’s hurting you.” As those political chips fall in place, other Democratic strategists and operatives say now is the time for Adams to focus on that base, with its backbone in Southeast Queens, and remind supporters why they voted for him in the first place. “Just because Caban resigned doesn’t mean that the problems are going to go away, even if he tries to cut ties with some of these folks,” Camille Rivera, a New York City-based political strategist, told CNN. “I would run a campaign now, I would be out there in the community, running my town halls, being in the districts, having conversations with my people and solidifying my base if I feel like I’ve done nothing wrong.” That message, though, has become increasingly tough to get across – and not only because of his Covid quarantine. In some of the most recent, in-depth polling, from December 2023, when he was only facing a probe into his campaign fundraising, Adams’s overall approval rating dropped to a staggering 28%, according to a Quinnipiac University survey. Hispanic voters, a critical part of his base, came in even lower at 20%. Among Black voters, Adams was still favored by 10 points, 48% to 38%, an advantage he cannot afford to forfeit. The mayor’s office lashed out over the poll, with a spokesman criticizing its methodology and pointing to falling crime – which has gone down in the city and nationally – and an improved economic outlook. Adams received a boost earlier in the summer when the Rev. Al Sharpton wrote an op-ed backing the mayor and suggesting that the opposition was racially-coded, recalling the defeat of the city’s first Black Mayor, David Dinkins, to Rudy Giuliani in 1993. “The criticism of Adams and the disconnect between perception and reality of his administration of this city is extreme,” Sharpton wrote. “Somehow it seems easier for those who are against him to get their message through, and for the damning, coded, curse of incompetence to be laid on his head.” Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, a Brooklyn Democratic leader and top ally, delivered a similar message last year, telling reporters she was “concerned about whether these investigations are just targeting him because he’s a Black mayor.” Adams has not directly embraced that narrative, but he has repeatedly cast himself as unduly persecuted – including referencing the Biblical Book of Job, the story of a righteous man whose faith is tested by a series of personal calamities. “I wish I could tell you that I had one moment in my life that was a Job moment. But I did not have one, I had many,” he said during a visit last Sunday to the Power and Authority Evangelical Ministry in East New York, another political stronghold. Adams is not the first mayor to find himself under investigation, but if prosecutors decide to bring charges, he could become the first New York mayor indicted in the modern era. Mayor Jimmy Walker resigned in 1932 while facing an investigation. More recently, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself in the crosshairs of investigators because of his fundraising practices before the US Attorney’s Office declined to bring charges against him. It’s still unclear when each of the Adams administration’s investigations began, but former Assistant US Attorney Jennifer Beidel says it’s possible that a phone seizure in one case could lead investigators onto another totally different case. “That’s one of the most dangerous things about having your electronic devices seized. We all have a lot of material on it,” said Beidel, now a government investigations attorney at the law firm Dykema. “So you don’t have much ability to limit where law enforcement takes that info after.” Despite the ongoing cases, Biedel told CNN it has become clear that federal law enforcement agencies are zeroed in on City Hall. “The goal in the public corruption unit is to focus their resources on conduct that is concerning,” she said. “They wouldn’t continue that apparent focus if they didn’t believe there was something there.” That reality, in legal but also political terms, is setting in among some of Adams’s closest allies and friends in the administration. “I had a number of FBI agents who came to my home and wanted my personal phone and my DOE phone, outside of that I don’t know a lot,” David Banks, the city schools chancellor, said on Friday, adding that federal agents have not yet returned his phones. “We will all wait and see where these investigations go.”"
"5 things to know for Sept. 16: Trump, Emmy Awards, Severe weather, Middle East, SpaceX | CNN","Published 6:43 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T10:43:45.589Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/us/5-things-to-know-for-sept-16-trump-emmy-awards-severe-weather-middle-east-spacex/index.html,"Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. The FBI is investigating an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at his Florida golf club on Sunday. Trump is safe and was not harmed in the incident, his campaign said. It comes just two months after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. Law enforcement sources on Sunday identified the person detained as a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii who frequently criticized Trump on social media. The man was detained shortly after the Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking through the fence of the golf course and agents fired at a man who was in the bushes along the perimeter. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris issued statements condemning political violence, adding that they will ensure that the Secret Service has all the resources necessary to protect the former president. The Primetime Emmy Awards, which honor the best in American television, were handed out Sunday in Los Angeles. It was a huge night for the historical epic “Shōgun,” which became the first ever non-English language series to win best drama, along with wins for lead actor, actress and directing. The comedy category saw big wins for the FX hit “The Bear,” including for star Jeremy Allen White. But it was “Hacks” — a women-led series about an aging stand-up and a young comedy writer — that took the outstanding comedy series prize. The Netflix show “Baby Reindeer” won the Emmy for outstanding limited series, anthology or TV movie. The show’s creator Richard Gadd won writing and acting Emmys, and supporting actress Jessica Gunning also took home a statuette for her performance. Here’s a list of all the winners. Some of the heaviest rain in decades hit parts of central and eastern Europe over the weekend, causing flooding and widespread disruptions. A low pressure system dubbed Storm Boris dumped months’ worth of rain onto several of Europe’s historic capitals, including Vienna, Bratislava and Prague. Red alerts, the highest-level warning, are still in effect for portions of Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia. At least eight people have died, authorities said. Meanwhile, Shanghai was brought to a standstill today by what China says is the city’s strongest storm in seven decades. Typhoon Bebinca made landfall in a suburb southeast of the metropolis with wind speeds of 80 mph, the equivalent of a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane. The Israeli military says that three Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza in December were “most likely” killed as a result of an Israeli airstrike. Recovering the hostages captured by Hamas on October 7 is one of the main goals of Israel’s campaign in Gaza as pressure builds to end the humanitarian crisis in the region. US officials are trying to get both sides to agree to a deal first laid out by President Biden in May. The three-phase proposal pairs the release of hostages with a “full and complete ceasefire.” Since then talks have stalled and both sides have pointed to what they see as glaring holes in the framework, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting that Israel’s forces will never leave the stretch along the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor. SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn all-civilian crew returned to Earth Sunday after a five-day mission to orbit that included the world’s first commercial spacewalk. The Crew Dragon capsule splashed down off the coast of Florida at 3:37 a.m. ET, concluding the high-risk event. The Polaris Dawn mission made history as it reached a higher altitude than any human has traveled in five decades. A spacewalk conducted on Thursday also marked the first time such an endeavor has been completed by a privately funded and operated mission. The crew’s apogee — or farthest point from Earth — made two crew members the first women ever to fly so far from our planet. Mid-Autumn Festival: Mooncakes, lanterns and so much more

Analysis: New apparent Trump assassination bid is another dark moment with unpredictable political consequences | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:44 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T04:00:19.798Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/political-consequences-trump-assassination-attempt-analysis/index.html,"There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided the tragedy of seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speak to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: that those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. In his most expansive reaction to what happened, Trump posted on his Truth Social network Sunday evening about what he described as “certainly an interesting day!” “I want to thank the U.S. Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated Patriots, and, all of Law Enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican Nominee in the upcoming Presidential Election, SAFE,” Trump wrote. “THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!” Vice President Kamala Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and President Joe Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” As crass as it may be to consider political ramifications in the immediate aftermath of an apparent assassination attempt, everything in America is politicized within minutes — especially with 50 days left until a close election. Trump — who within seconds of surviving his first, much closer assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, stood up and said, “fight, fight, fight” — quickly released a fundraising email on Sunday afternoon that read, “I am Safe and Well!” “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” Trump wrote in the email that linked to a site allowing supporters to donate. And one of the ex-president’s top allies, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, released a statement reprising the idea Trump was spared by divine providence, which was a recurrent theme at the Republican National Convention. The House GOP conference chair suggested that after what had happened, the country now had a duty to elect Trump. “Thankfully, God continues to watch over President Trump. As Americans we must unite behind him in November to protect our republic and bring peace back to the world,” she said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, after visiting the former president at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Sunday, also suggested that Trump had benefited from divine intervention and played into the narrative that Trump is unbeatable. “No leader (in) American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient. He is unstoppable.” That sense of Trump being protected by God animated his supporters’ feeling at the Milwaukee convention that he was destined for victory. Such assumptions were dampened, however, when Biden shelved his reelection bid, allowing Harris to jump in and transform the contest. The man detained in the apparent assassination attempt had been spotted by the Secret Service several holes ahead of the former president at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Stefanik asked how “an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again?” She wrote: “There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened today in Florida.” The New York Republican’s questioning of the Secret Service is likely to foreshadow debate in the coming days about the level of the former president’s protection — especially given what happened in Butler. Trump has already suggested, without evidence, that the Biden administration and Harris were complicit in the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania because he claims they weaponized the Justice Department against him. But all of Trump’s criminal problems have proceeded through regular order in the courts, and there is no evidence that the White House is in any way involved. The second apparent assassination attempt comes against the backdrop of a turbulent campaign that has defied convention and predictions. For the first time since 1968, a sitting president folded his reelection campaign within months of the election, reluctantly making way for his vice president, who has a chance to become the first Black woman and South Asian commander in chief. The Republican nominee is a convicted felon who is facing multiple criminal charges over his unprecedented attempt to stay in power after losing the last election. If he is returned to the White House, Trump would be only the second president who lost reelection to win a nonconsecutive second term. The ex-president’s actions in the coming days will be closely watched. After the first assassination attempt, the former president called on the country to come together. But his unity pledge didn’t last much longer than the first third of his speech at the Republican National Convention, which degenerated into the characteristic divisiveness on which he built his political career. Trump has also repeatedly ignored the advice of senior Republicans and his campaign team to stick to a sharp, concise argument against Harris. They’d like him to focus on her role in the Biden administration’s economic policy at a time when many voters are still struggling with high prices despite a lowering of the inflation rate. So even if his aides counsel him to renew his national unity theme, there’s no guarantee Trump will listen or consider it in his political interests. Another apparent attempt on his life is likely to have some level of personal impact on the former president. In the days after narrowly cheating death or serious injury in Pennsylvania when a bullet grazed his ear, Trump seemed chastened. But ever since, he has returned to his rambunctious self and, if anything, his rhetoric has become even more extreme. He’s recently been warning his political opponents that he will turn the law against them and lock them up if he considers the election fraudulent, and he has doubled down on his baseless claims that the last election was stolen. In the immediate aftermath of Sunday’s incident, the focus of most Trump opponents was on maintaining calm at a volatile moment. There can be no justification in a democracy for attempting to silence any political figure by violence. At the same time, however, in the coming days, there will be debate about the extent to which the former president — a uniquely inflammatory figure — has helped to stoke the nation’s divides. Earlier this weekend, for example, the ex-president and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had been heightening political tensions. Both Republicans have highlighted baseless claims that Haitian refugees in Springfield, Ohio, have been stealing and eating pets. Trump’s opponents have warned that his continued racial demagoguery is putting lives at risk. In a contentious interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Vance insisted that the claims about the Haitian migrants — who are in the United States legally — were validated by complaints from some of his constituents. And far from backing away from the story — despite testimony from multiple local officials that there’s no truth to the rumor — Vance angrily condemned suggestions that recent bomb threats against the city had anything to do with him and Trump escalating the claims. He told Dana Bash: “This town has suffered terribly under the problem — under the policies of Kamala Harris.” But Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, asked on ABC on Sunday whether he had seen any evidence of the pet-eating rumors, said, “No. Absolutely not.” The Ohio governor added that the Haitian migrants, whom Trump threatened on Friday to deport to Venezuela, were in the country legally. In normal circumstances, an apparent assassination attempt against a presidential candidate might be expected to unleash a surge of sympathy that could translate into a political boost. But the latest near-miss for Trump comes at a moment when the race with Harris is neck-and-neck. While both candidates are fighting over perhaps several hundred thousand movable voters in swing states, it’s not clear how much room remains for changing perceptions about Trump, who has been a polarizing figure ever since his 2015 launch of his first national campaign. The former president is all but certain to use the latest events to reinforce his baseless claim that he’s a victim of persecution meant to keep him from power. But it’s too early to say whether the second apparent assassination attempt will have greater political impact than the first. Ultimately, it’s going to be up to voters to sort out this unpredictable and dangerous campaign season."
Man detained in apparent assassination attempt on Trump criticized former president on social media | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:14 PM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-16T01:46:36.263Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/trump-attempted-assassination-man-detained/index.html,"A 58-year-old man detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida is a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii who went on social media to weigh in on politics and current events, at times criticizing the former president. Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf, posted comments on an X account linked to him referencing the assassination attempt on Trump at a July rally in Pennsylvania. Routh tagged Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, in separate posts, encouraging them to visit those injured at the rally. “You and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally and attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them,” he wrote in a post directed at Harris. In an April post on X tagging President Biden’s presidential account, he wrote that Biden’s campaign should be: “called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA …make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.” In June 2020, Routh appeared to say that he had voted for Trump in 2016, but that he had since withdrawn his support of the former president: “While you were my choice in 2106, I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment and it seems you are getting worse and devolving,” he wrote. “I will be glad when you gone.” Routh also has ties to North Carolina, where public records show he registered as an “unaffiliated” voter without a party in 2012. He voted in that state’s Democratic primary in March of this year, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. Routh has contributed more than $100 to ActBlue, which processes donations for Democrats, federal campaign finance records show. Routh expressed strong support for Ukraine – in dozens of posts on X in 2022, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.” “I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE…Can I be the example We must win,” Routh said in an X post in March 2022. Routh then used his personal Facebook account last year to encourage foreigners to fight in the war. He tried to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts, beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government. “Afghan Soldiers- Ukraine is somewhat interested in 3000 soldiers, so I need every soldier that has a passport to send me a copy of their passport to send to Ukraine,” he wrote in one such post, which was published in English and Pashto. Routh’s LinkedIn page says he started a company in 2018 called Camp Box Honolulu, which builds storage units and tiny houses; a story in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser said he donated a structure for homeless people. “Work has never been about money rather building frameworks for people to thrive and succeed,” Routh wrote on his LinkedIn page. “Being mechanically minded I enjoy ideas and invention and creative projects with artistic flare.” The company’s website says it uses standard economical, fast and efficient construction techniques and materials to “produce solutions to our own problems right here on the island.” A Hawaiian man who gave Routh a bad review on Facebook told CNN he was unsettled by Routh’s response to the criticism. Saili Levi, owner of a vanilla company, said he had paid Routh $3,800 up front to build a trailer for his business, but when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. “I kind of decided maybe I should just let it go for the sake of my family.” Records from North Carolina, dating back a couple of decades, also show that he had scrapes with the law. In 2002, Routh was arrested after he was pulled over by police and allegedly put his hand on a firearm before barricading himself in a business, according to a Greensboro News & Record article that year that cited police. A law enforcement confirmed the arrest to CNN on Sunday. Public records reveal several court cases involving Routh since the 1990s. State and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. For example, he faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records. In 1998, the state alleged he committed an offense related to a “worthless check,” though that case was dismissed. Separately, judges have ordered him to pay tens of thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits. Routh’s eldest son, Oran, told CNN via text that Routh was “a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man.” The son wrote, “I don’t know what’s happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I’ve heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent.”"
Golf courses — in particular Trump’s — have long proved a difficult assignment for Secret Service | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:00 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-15T23:02:19.451Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/trump-golf-course-security-challenges/index.html,"Golf courses, and in particular former President Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds while the commander in chief plays, according to people familiar with the matter. While security around Trump was bolstered in the aftermath of the first attempt on his life over the summer, the new beefed-up protective detail wasn’t able to prevent another would-be assassin from coming within 500 yards of the former president, armed with an AK-47 with a telescopic sight on Sunday. In some ways, a similar issue led to both situations: difficulty securing a perimeter around the former president. A golf course presents a particular challenge. The fairways and greens of a golf course are often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements such as trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Officials said at a news conference Sunday that a suspected would-be shooter hid in a patch of bushes on the perimeter of Trump’s golf course before a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of his weapon. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the former president as he plays and secure the areas in the several minutes before he arrives. Trump, like presidents before him, likes to drive his own golf cart — one of the only opportunities a sitting or former president has to drive any kind of vehicle. People familiar with the matter said the president’s golf cart is not equipped with any special protective measures, though it does have a presidential seal affixed to it. Sometimes, agents use metal detecting wands to screen players and other guests before they come into close proximity to the former president. And while there have been efforts in the past to restrict who can come near Trump while he’s at one of his clubs, he likes socializing with members. Trump International Golf Club, in West Palm Beach, abuts three heavily trafficked roads, Kirk Road, Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. The Palm Beach International Airport is nearby. As president, Trump could often be spotted from across from Kirk Road when he was playing golf. But members of the media were not permitted to stand on the sidewalks near the golf course when Trump was playing. After he left office, some of those restrictions were lifted. Members of the public were able to have a clear view of Trump from the sidewalks on Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. In a briefing Sunday, the Palm Beach County sheriff acknowledged some of the security concerns. “The level where he is at right now, he is not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had the entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, security is limited to the areas the Secret Service deems possible,” Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said. “I would imagine the next time (Trump) comes to the golf course, there would probably be a little more people around the perimeter,” Bradshaw added. When Barack Obama was president, his most frequent golf outing was to the links at Joint Base Andrews, which by its nature on a military installation had restricted access — both to the course itself and to its surroundings. President Joe Biden rarely golfs. This story has been updated with additional information."
The latest on the 76th Emmy Awards | CNN,No Results Found,2024-09-15T21:07:47.446Z,https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/live-news/emmy-awards-levy-09-15-24/index.html,"The Primetime Emmy Awards, which honor the best in American television, have just wrapped up tonight in Los Angeles. Eugene and Dan Levy, the father-and-son duo who co-starred in the sitcom “Schitt’s Creek,” hosted the show from the Peacock Theater. See some of the best photos from the night: Look back on more memorable moments here. From nostalgic TV reunions to “The Bear’s” Liza Colón-Zayas beating Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett to win outstanding supporting comedy actress, the night was all about reminding us how surprising and wonderful television was, is and can be. Bringing together famous television dads, moms, coaches, cops, doctors and lawyers by presenting actors who played them in iconic TV shows gave viewers the opportunity to reminisce about some of their favorite series and characters. Some of “The West Wing” cast came together toward the end of the night to the delight of the audience to present an award and to encourage everyone to vote in this year’s election. Earlier, Henry Winkler and Ron Howard appeared onstage to reminisce about the legendary series that made them household names, “Happy Days.” While things are pretty contentious these days, it was a joy to remember when simply picking which channel to watch was the most stressful part of TV. But all isn’t lost and there was also plenty to remind us that the industry is still churning out some pretty good work, even in the face of the ever-expanding crush of content. Jean Smart’s joke about believing the hit Netflix series “Baby Reindeer” was about Rudolph the red-nosed one was well-timed, providing the perfect setup for that show to win the Emmy for limited/anthology series, along with acting trophies for star and creator Richard Gadd and his costar Jessica Gunning. The dark drama is actually based on Gadd’s experience with a woman he said started as a friend and turned into a stalker. He had some words of wisdom in one of his acceptance speeches. Hopefully, Hollywood continues to take note regarding good storytelling, and leans into Gadd’s urging to “dare” and take risks. Ultimately, though, Emmys night kept coming back to the theme of representation and the constant need to do better. Colón-Zayas became the first Latina to ever win in her category, which was a good reminder that there are still some hills left to climb in Hollywood. “Shōgun” won top honors as outstanding drama show, becoming the first ever non-English language series to win the award. And “Hacks” was somewhat of a surprise winner in the outstanding comedy series category, placing a women-led series that deals with sexism and later-life career struggles in the spotlight. Encapsulating the energy of the night, John Leguizamo gave an impassioned speech paying tribute to the historic Latinx nominees and recognizing other minorities in the Emmy nominee pool, saying he was “one of Hollywood’s DEI hires,” going on to define DEI as “diligence, excellence and imagination.” “We are all DEI hires,” Leguizamo said. It was Rose family reunion on the Emmys stage Sunday evening when “Schitt’s Creek” stars Catherine O’Hara and Annie Murphy joined hosts Dan and Eugene Levy. Murphy, with the Levys, took to the stage at first, with Murphy joking that she heard they’d asked the “shining star of ‘Schitt’s Creek’” to present the final award. Dan Levy then broke the news to his onscreen sister that the person in question actually wasn’t her, and the three of them then introduced O’Hara to present the final award of the evening. O’Hara, who played Rose family matriarch and TV icon Moira Rose on “Schitt’s Creek,” joked that she was “shocked and delighted” to be presenting the award for best comedy series. After O’Hara jokingly tore up the winner’s envelope, crying out about why “must we really choose a winner,” she pulled out the actual winner’s envelope and announced that “Hacks” won the Emmy for best comedy. “Hacks” has won the Emmy for outstanding comedy series, earning the top award despite stiff competition from “The Bear.” Writer and co-creator Paul W. Downs thanked the cast, crew and writers of the show and made a case for more representation onscreen while accepting the award. The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. The third season of “Hacks” finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. Red carpet season is underway: The biggest names in television descended on LA’s Peacock Theater for the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards tonight.  Check out some of the most memorable looks from the night:  See all the best photos from the red carpet here. “Shōgun” has won the Emmy for outstanding drama series, making it the first ever non-English language series to do so. Hiroyuki Sanada, who won an Emmy for outstanding lead actor from the show, then gave his speech in Japanese, which Marks translated. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. About a week after its debut, Disney reported that the first episode garnered 9 million views globally across its streaming platforms Hulu+, Disney+ and Star+, making it the company’s top scripted general entertainment series premiere globally. CNN’s Christy Choi, Julia Chatterley and Lisa Respers France contributed to this post. Anna Sawai took home the Emmy award for outstanding lead actress in a drama series for her role as Lady Mariko in “Shōgun.” It’s her first Emmy win and nomination. While accepting her award, she thanked the Television Academy, her fellow nominees within the category, her family as well as her cast and crew. “This is to all the women who expect nothing and continue to be an example to everyone,” she said. “Shōgun,” the epic historical drama, is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. CNN’s Christy Choi and Julia Chatterley contributed reporting. Christine Baranksi, Viola Davis and Gina Torres appeared on stage to argue their case for why lawyers are among some of television’s favorite — and most astute — characters.  “The lawyer sees our witness,” Baranski — who played Diane Lockhart on “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” — said.  Davis, who portrayed professor of defense law Annalise Keating in “How to Get Away with Murder,” added one caveat: “Lawyers have seen every combination of the human condition and their efforts.” Torres added that in so many ways, lawyers work to “better the human condition.” The actress embodied Jessica Pearson in the legal drama series “Suits.” The trio appeared on stage to present the award for lead actress in a drama series. The Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a drama series goes to Hiroyuki Sanada. This is his first nomination and first Emmy win. “Shōgun” is notching some major victories tonight, and is one to watch later tonight. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, is only the second non-English language program to be nominated in the outstanding drama category. The series is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. CNN spoke with Sanada, who plays Lord Yoshii Toranaga, about how showrunners brought the series to life. CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this post. The dark Netflix hit “Baby Reindeer” took home the Primetime Emmy award on Sunday night for best limited or anthology series. He introduced and thanked the show’s cast and crew who was onstage alongside him. Gadd also went on to highlight the show’s willingness to take risks and encouraged other showrunners to do the same. “There’s no set formula to this,” he said, urging people to “take risks, push boundaries, explore the uncomfortable, dare to fail in order to achieve.” Jodie Foster, the two-time Oscar-winning actress, has won the first Emmy of her career. Foster was recognized as best lead actress in a limited series, anthology or TV movie for her work in “True Detective: Night Country.” “This is an incredibly emotional moment for me because ‘True Detective: North Country’ was just a magical experience,” Foster said. She thanked her “champ and my partner in crime” Kali Reis, her costar on the show.  Foster also highlighted the indigenous people of northern Alaska, who figure in the show. Richard Gadd has won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a limited series, anthology or TV movie, earning recognition for “Baby Reindeer,” a project he created based on his own harrowing experience with a stalker. While accepting his award — which is his second Emmy of the night — Gadd thanked the show’s directors “for bringing out the best in me,” as well as his parents.  “They’re the best,” he said of his mom and dad, adding that they’ve been through “some trying times as a family.” “Baby Reindeer” is a dramatized version of real events that happened to series creator and actor Gadd. In the show, Gadd’s character, Donny, meets Martha (Emmy-winner Jessica Gunning) at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. “Baby Reindeer” has topped most-watched lists worldwide since its debut in April, generating headlines and speculation about the characters and who inspired them. Gadd’s story is real, but he says the version that appears in his thriller miniseries has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. CNN’s Sydney Bishop and Hilary Whiteman contributed reporting. Jimmy Smits, Niecy Nash-Betts and Don Johnson pulled up to the Emmys stage to reflect on their roles as TV cops.  Smits described his “NYPD Blue” character, Det. Bobby Simone, as a “strong and sensitive, street-smart type,” while Nash-Betts joked her “Reno 911!” character, Deputy Raineesha Williams, got by on the job by only having “marginal knowledge of the law.”  Johnson’s character in “Nash Bridges,” meanwhile, played by his own rules but always brought the bad guy to justice.  Smits begrudgingly then pointed out that his “NYPD Blue” character died by the end of it, but Nash-Betts had better luck — her characters always survive.  This year’s In Memoriam was a little bit country with award-winning country singer Jelly Roll performing. Jelly Roll performed his song “I Am Not Okay” and talked about the “healing power” of music and storytelling. Dionne Harmon, one of the awards shows producers, told Variety the singer took a break from his tour to perform for the Emmys Sunday. “He is literally stepping off tour for a day and going right back on the road when he’s done,” said Harmon. “So, we’re so grateful to him. Jesse did a lot of begging to get that!” Music director Rickey Minor told the publication before the show he thought the “decision of what particular song to do will touch everyone.” “I cry every time I hear it,” Minor said. “Everyone at home, make sure you have tons of tissue around.” Following the performance Jimmy Kimmel remembered legendary comedic actor Bob Newhart who died this year. Actor John Leguizamo appeared on stage to recognize the diversity among the nominees at Sunday’s ceremony and speak to representation in Hollywood. He started off specifically honoring the many Latinx nominees present in the audience, including Selena Gomez, Nava Mau and Liza Colón-Zayas. Leguizamo joked that he’s one of “Hollywood’s DEI hires,” going on to define DEI to mean “diligence, excellence and imagination.” (DEI is an acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion, and has been a political flashpoint.) Leguizamo spoke about how when he was younger, he didn’t know that people like him, a person of Latin descent, could be actors.  Leguizamo then recalled the full-page ad he took out in the New York Times directed at the Television Academy, calling on voters to “recognize candidates of color,” joking wryly that the ad alone had solved all the problems in the industry. This year’s list of nominees, he said, is “among the most diverse” in history. With more of the drama categories now in focus, we might be entering the “Shōgun” period of the program. The historical drama just won for best directing in a drama series. “Thank you so much for this,” director Frederick E. O. Toye said.  He thanked Hulu, Disney and FX for giving him the honor to participate in the project.  He thanked the “team of amazing actors and actresses who led the way. I owe them everything,” he said. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, became only the second non-English language program to be nominated in the outstanding drama category. The epic historical drama is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. About a week after its debut, Disney reported that the first episode garnered 9 million views globally across its streaming platforms Hulu+, Disney+ and Star+, making it the company’s top scripted general entertainment series premiere globally. CNN’s Christy Choi and Julia Chatterley contributed to this report. The Emmys went for the gold Sunday night. Jane Lynch and Brendan Hunt — who played coaches on “Glee” and “Ted Lasso,” respectively — presented the best directing for a drama award and had some fun while they were at it, appearing in a locker room set and cracking some jokes. Lynch, who also played Sue Sylvester on “Glee,” teased Hunt that his role as Coach Beard on “Ted Lasso” was just an assistant coach, while she was a head coach. They were joined on stage by several Olympic athletes, including Olympic gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik, who captured hearts this summer as the “Clark Kent” of pommel horse. The FX restaurant dramedy “The Bear” is having a very strong night, as expected. It just picked up another Emmy, this time recognizing Christopher Storer for best directing in a comedy series. Season two of “The Bear” produced some of the most memorable episodes in the series’ history, with the cameo-heavy midseason Christmas episode “Fishes,” earning Storer the win tonight. The episode — a moving portrait of family trauma — generated buzz with its ensemble of guest stars, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, John Mulaney and Jon Bernthal.  Welcome back to the Fonz. The man who played that beloved character, Henry Winkler, reunited with his “Happy Days” costar, Ron Howard, for a little bit of throwback love for the popular series. The pair came together to present an award, but also to remind us all of how much we enjoyed the wholesome show in which Howard started out playing teen Richie Cunningham and introduced the world to his friends and family. “Happy Days” ran over the course of 11 seasons from 1974 to 1984, and won one Primetime Emmy for film editing in 1978. The show enjoyed several other Emmy nominations, including three for Henry Winkler for playing Arthur “The Fonz” Fonzarelli. “Happy Days” firmly put Winkler on the showbiz map, as it did Howard. The Oscar-winning director got his start playing Richie Cunningham on the series. “Happy Days” also led to popular spinoff series including “Joanie Loves Chachi” (1982–83), “Laverne and Shirley” (1976–83), and “Mork and Mindy” (1978–82). The show also helped make the phrase “jump the shark” a thing after Winkler’s character did just that as the series waned in popularity towards the end. The Fonz literally jumped a shark on the show. Richard Gadd took home the Emmy award for outstanding writing for a limited series, anthology or movie. Gadd marked the moment by making a heartfelt speech, reflecting on his personal experience to offer up inspiration for those going through a hard time. A twisty and engrossing tale involving stalking, grooming, abuse and artistic license, “Baby Reindeer” was a sensation when it debuted and has since remained a focus of attention, with some of the real-life players behind it disputing the story’s veracity. Lawsuit context: The series is actually the subject of a lawsuit. Netflix said in June that it would fight a multimillion-dollar claim for damages brought by a Scottish woman who alleges she was defamed by the hit show and its portrayal of a female stalker.  Fiona Harvey is seeking a jury trial and damages totaling $170 million for “mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of business,” according to a complaint filed in the District Court for the Central District of California. The document alleges that the defendants and Gadd told the “biggest lie in television history” by claiming the story is true. For his part, Gadd previously told UK newspaper The Guardian the story is “very emotionally true” but that he wanted the series to exist as a piece of art and protect the identities of those involved. His repeated requests, however, for viewers to cease trying to find out the real-life identities of the figures in his story went unheard. In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Netflix said, “We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd’s right to tell his story.” CNN’s Dan Heching and Hilary Whiteman contributed reporting. Actors Mindy Kaling, Zach Braff and Mekhi Phifer, who have all played TV doctors, appeared on stage to present the award for outstanding writing for a drama series. Phifer, who played a doctor on the hit NBC medical drama “ER,” said he was “so honored” to play a doctor on the show and that he was inspired by all of the physicians he’s known.  Kaling starred as an OB/GYN on her namesake series “The Mindy Project,” and said she was inspired to play a doctor because of her mother, who was also an OB/GYN.  Braff, however, didn’t have as moving of a statement when it came to sharing the inspiration behind playing his beloved role as a doctor on the long-running sitcom “Scrubs.”  “I was inspired to not live like that anymore,” Braff joked.   Lamorne Morris takes home the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a limited series or TV movie for his role on “Fargo.” Morris thanked God, his mother, daughter, cast, the category’s other nominees as well as FX and Hulu while accepting his award. “Oh my god I’m forgetting so many people,” he said, adding that he will thank those he didn’t mention in his speech later, on his podcast. A fan-adored anthology crime series conceived from the Oscar-winning 1996 film of the same name, “Fargo’s” fifth season is in the mix this year with 15 Primetime Emmy nods, having previously won six statuettes in years past. CNN’s Dan Heching contributed reporting. The Emmy for outstanding talk series is awarded to “The Daily Show,” and longtime host John Stewart is up on the stage with the rest of the cast. It was the TV moms’ turn when Susan Kelechi Watson, Connie Britton and Meredith Baxter appeared on stage to present the award for comedy writing.  Britton, who famously played a mom on “Friday Night Lights” and “White Lotus,” said that TV moms “do it all,” whether that be a country music star (on “Nashville”), the head of a “haunted household” or a school principal.  Kelechi Watson, who played mom Beth Pearson on NBC hit show “This is Us,” added that “TV moms are no longer one dimensional… We have choices.”  Kelechi Watson also joked that “it’s ok to ask for as much money as a TV dad.” Baxter — classic TV mom of “Family Ties” fame — also touched on how far TV mom roles have come, saying she’s thankful “we are way past the days where we couldn’t even say the word ‘pregnant’ on ‘I Love Lucy.’” “Hacks” earns the award for outstanding writing for a comedy series at the Emmys, and the cast used their acceptance speech to crack a few jokes. Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky took the award for the episode “Bulletproof.” It’s the second Emmy win for the “Hacks” writers in this category. Downs said the trio of writers chose to write about comedy because they were “three weird lonely kids — it was the thing that made us feel connected to other people.” Statsky and Angelo then playfully corrected Downs, whispering in his ear for him to say they weren’t unpopular. The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. The third season of “Hacks” finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. While presenting the award for writing for a variety special, “Saturday Night Live” vets Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, Bowen Yang and Seth Meyers took the opportunity to poke fun at their current and former boss, “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels.  Wiig joked that Michaels has “lost the Emmy” over 80 times. “You do have value. You are worthy and you are not, and have never been a loser, even though you have lost a lot,” Wiig joked, speaking directly to Michaels in the audience.  Rudolph went on to joke that he was “robbed” every single time he lost, while Yang playfully kept pronouncing his last name wrong.  Meyers pointed out that “SNL” has won many Emmys, with the long-running sketch comedy series earning over 300 nods with 90 wins. “I can’t believe that you’re complaining about this Lorne,” Rudolph said. “Not to be rude but, grow up!” Michaels has won 21 Emmys. It’s never been uncommon for presenters and winners to make political statements at award shows, but it’s especially prevalent in years when there are major elections. This year, with the presidential election happening in just a few weeks, it was to be expected. Then, just hours before Sunday night’s Emmy Awards, there was an apparent second assassination attempt against Republican former President Donald Trump. That could make taking jabs at Trump fraught, but a few people have still worked in some form of political statement. Billy Crudup, who won outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his work on “The Morning Show,” shouted out his wife, Naomi Watts. Watts scored a nomination for her performance as Babe Paley in FX’s anthology series “FEUD: Capote vs. The Swans.” Immigration is a major topic in this year’s election, particularly over the past week, when the GOP ticket has made increasingly inflammatory remarks about Haitian immigrants in the town of Springfield, Ohio. “Murphy Brown” star Candice Bergen drew some laughs by referencing Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s now infamous comment about “childless cat ladies,” after reminiscing about making TV history when her character was attacked in the media by Republican Dan Quayle for a plot line about her being a single mother. Near the top of the show, Selena Gomez also made a reference to the “childless cat ladies” phenomenon when onstage with her “Only Murders in the Building” costars Steve Martin and Martin Short. Jessica Gunning wins outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or TV movie at the 76th Emmy Awards for her twisted role in “Baby Reindeer.” “Oh my goodness me. Blinking heckers, thank you so much,” Gunning began her remarks. “I’m so proud to be a part of ‘Baby Reindeer,’” she said. Gunning then gave an emotional nod to creator of and lead actor in the show, Richard Gadd. “Thank you for trusting me to be your Martha. I will never ever forget her or you,” she said. More on the show: “Baby Reindeer” is a dramatized version of real events that happened to Gadd. In the show, Gadd’s character, Donny, meets Martha at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. “Baby Reindeer” has topped most-watched lists worldwide since its debut in April, generating headlines and speculation about the characters and who inspired them. Gadd’s story is real, but he says the version that appears in his thriller miniseries has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. CNN’s Sydney Bishop and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report. The antics continued with hosts Dan and Eugene Levy, who awkwardly introduced actors and TV villains Kathy Bates, Antony Starr and Giancarlo Esposito from opposite sides of the aisle.  “I don’t know where my dad is,” Dan Levy said, looking around for Eugene Levy, who eventually waved from the ‘wrong’ aisle.  Dan Levy hilariously admonished his father for getting lost in the theater, to which Eugene Levy replied, “I don’t like doing bits in the audience. Never have!” Selena Gomez and her boyfriend Benny Blanco, along with Steve Martin and Paul Rudd, were all in the frame laughing along to the lost Levys bit. The Emmy for outstanding reality or competition series goes to “The Traitors.” The show’s host Alan Cumming thanked Peacock, the cast and crew as well as his home country, Scotland, while accepting the show’s award. The 10-episode reality competition murder mystery show features 20 contestants — 10 of whom have previously appeared on reality programs like “Survivor,” “Below Deck,” “Big Brother” and “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” — competing for $250,000. CNN previously spoke to Cumming about packing for “The Traitors.” Read what some of his travel must-haves are here. CNN’s Jolie Kerr contributed reporting. Jean Smart takes home the award for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series for her role in “Hack” at the Emmys. “Thank you so, so much,” Smart began her speech. “It’s very humbling, it really is and I appreciate this because I — I just don’t get enough attention,” she joked.  Tonight’s win is Smart’s third for “Hacks.” She has won six Primetime Emmys in total. More on the show: The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. In an interview with CNN’s Chris Wallace earlier this year, Smart said she was a bit apprehensive to play opposite Einbinder, a comedian in real life and the daughter of the “Saturday Night Live” original cast member Laraine Newman. Smart said she had never done standup comedy before taking on the role of the brilliant and biting comedian Vance. CNN’s Tori B. Powell and Marianne Garvey contributed to this report. Elizabeth Debicki takes home the Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series. While accepting her award, Debicki — who starred as the “People’s Princess” in “The Crown” — thanked the show’s creator Peter Morgan, as well as the cast and crew behind the series. This is Debicki’s first Emmy win. More on the show: Netflix’s jewel, “The Crown,” has traversed 60 years of world history through the lens of the British monarchy. Debicki played Princess Diana in the most recent season as well as the fifth — a performance for which she earned Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. She’s previously appeared in the BBC’s crime series “The Night Manager,” plus two “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies, “The Man from U.N.C.L.E” and Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” among others. CNN’s Alli Rosenbloom and Sandy Thin contributed reporting. The Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series goes to Liza Colón-Zayas for her role in “The Bear.” “Thank for lowering the microphone for me, thank you so much,” Colón-Zayas began her speech. She then noted how her husband told her not to write a speech. “How-how could I have thought it would be possible to be in the presence” of her fellow nominees including Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett, she asked. “I love you all. I revere you all to the bottom of my heart,” she said. Colón-Zayas also thanked the cast and directors of the show. “Thank you for giving me new life with this show,” she said.  And finally she had a message “to all Latinas who are looking at me, keep believing and vote, vote for your rights, thank you,” While presenting the Emmy for lead actor in a comedy series, famed TV dads Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Damon Wayans and George Lopez took the opportunity to thank their TV wives (and husband). “To be a great TV dad,” Lopez said, you have to have a great TV spouse. Wayans thanked his “My Wife and Kids” co-star Tisha Campbell, Lopez thanked his “George Lopez” show TV wife Constance Marie and Ferguson thanked his “Modern Family” TV husband Eric Stonestreet. “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White wins outstanding lead actor in a comedy series at the 76th Emmy Awards. “This show has changed my life,” White said while accepting the award for his lead role in Hulu and FX’s beloved culinary series. “It has instilled a faith that change is possible,” he continued, adding, “if you are able to reach out, you are really truly never actually alone.” He also thanked the Television Academy as well as his cast mates and his family. White plays Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, the nervy, ultra-talented chef who returns to his hometown of Chicago following the tragic death of his brother. The chance to take over his family’s restaurant comes with a return to the Berzattos’ fraught relationships and past traumas. The show is buoyed by a stellar supporting cast as it explores Carmy’s personal and professional life through the brooding performance of White. CNN’s Matt Meyer contributed reporting. Billy Crudup earned the award for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his role in “The Morning Show” at the Emmys.  “This is an incredible honor, thank you all,” Crudup said. He then gave a shoutout to his wife, actress Naomi Watts, who he noted is an immigrant, and listed her many accolades and successful endeavors.  “This process has been incredible for me and I hope everybody else that’s involved knows how much it means to me,” he said. More on the show: The stakes were raised even higher in the third season of the “The Morning Show” of this taut workplace drama featuring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. The show has already taken home three Primetime Emmys in years past, including one in 2020 for supporting actor Billy Crudup. CNN’s Lisa Respers France and Dan Heching contributed to this report. Ebon Moss-Bachrach wins outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series at the 76th Emmy Awards. While accepting his award, Moss-Bachrach said he’s “so grateful” for “The Bear” and spoke about how much of a “privilege” it was to work with his cast members, whom he referred to as his “incredible family.” Moss-Bachrach also thanked his parents, who he joked are “taking such nice care of my cat” as well as his children. Hulu and FX’s beloved culinary series is about the inner workings of a high-pressured chef and his staff in a Chicago restaurant. Nominally considered a comedy at tonight’s awards, “The Bear” can be very funny. But it’s best known for its tension-drenched scenes inside the kitchen and its moving exploration of family dynamics. The show has risen from a favorite of TV nerds to the next “prestige TV” hit, while the restaurant at the center of the series has transformed from a sandwich shop to a high-end eatery. Father-son duo and Emmys hosts Dan and Eugene Levy kicked off Sunday’s ceremony joking about how hosting is a new experience for the pair, who joked they “more like actors acting like hosts.”  Dan Levy acknowledged this is the first time they worked together since starring alongside each other in “Schitt’s Creek,” which ended in 2020. Eugene Levy spoke of his famed roles playing movie and TV dads — including his role in “American Pie” — and joked that his best “dad role” was in “Schitt’s Creek” because it won him his first Emmy. The Canadian-bred actors joked about how they don’t wish to cut any winners off early while they make their acceptance speeches, with Eugene Levy saying, “If you’re going to say anything meaningful or emotional or, god forbid, political, just keep it short…” Schitt’s Creek ran from 2015 to 2020 and starred Catherine O’Hara, Annie Murphy, Emily Hampshire and Noah Reid, among others. The series won nine Emmys during its run, with five of those wins coming in 2020 for the beloved series’ final season. Dan Levy, Eugene Levy, O’Hara and Murphy all swept the acting categories, and the show won best comedy. Lots of the evening’s men are eschewing traditional black-tie in favor of something more flamboyant. “Abbott Elementary” star Chris Perfetti impressed in a theatrical ruffled shirt from Christian Siriano’s Spring 2025 ready-to-wear collection and “Fallout” star Aaron Moten arrived in an all-red Kenzo suit with a Nehru collar. “The Traitors” actor Alan Cumming and fellow Scot Richard Gadd, creator of “Baby Reindeer,” both wore kilts (in black and traditional tartan, respectively), with the former’s plaid cummerbund train emerging from his cream Teddy von Ranson jacket to double up as a scarf.Even those men opting for more conventional tailoring incorporated playful touches, from host Dan Levy’s sculpted Loewe neckline to the silky unbuttoned shirt of Jonathan Bailey’s Giorgio Armani suit.

Joe McCarthy (Chris Bauer) and his closeted right-hand man Roy Cohn (Will Brill), who are determined to root out gays to advance their political objectives.

Queens from the hit show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” have arrived on the red carpet in an array of colorful looks. The reality competition series, where drag queens battle it out in glamorous challenges for the crown, first aired in 2009 on Logo TV. It has exploded in popularity with more than 15 seasons across three networks, winning 29 Primetime Emmys and spawning a spinoff “All Stars” series, international versions and even a Monopoly game along the way. Check out more of tonight’s best looks in our Emmys red carpet photo gallery CNN’s Dan Heching contributed reporting. The limited series “Baby Reindeer” has topped most-watched lists worldwide since its debut in April, gripping audiences on Netflix while generating headlines and speculation. Series creator and actor Richard Gadd says it is a dramatized version of real events that happened to him, but that it has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. He’s also repeatedly urged fans not to seek out the real-life inspirations for the project, which is about a man who is aggressively stalked by a woman he meets in a London bar. But that hasn’t dissuaded super-fans and online sleuths, and now a Scottish woman who says she was defamed by the hit show is seeking a jury trial and damages totaling $170 million for “mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of business,” according to California court filings. The document alleges that the defendants and Gadd told the “biggest lie in television history” by claiming the story is true. For his part, Gadd previously told UK newspaper The Guardian the story is “very emotionally true” but that he wanted the series to exist as a piece of art and to protect the identities of those involved. In a June statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Netflix said, “We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd’s right to tell his story.” Selena Gomez has arrived on the red carpet. “Only Murders in the Building,” which Gomez acts in and produces, scored 21 primetime Emmy nominations this year, including her first individual acting nomination. The series stars Gomez, Steve Martin and Martin Short as three neighbors in an upscale New York building who are true crime fans.

More are listed in our full Emmy shows viewing guide “Shōgun,” the historical drama based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, broke a record with its 25 Emmy nominations. The series became only the second non-English language program to be nominated in the outstanding drama category. The hit Netflix series “Squid Game” was the first in 2022. “Shōgun” also earned nominations for several of its stars, including Hiroyuki Sanada for outstanding lead actor in a drama series; Anna Sawai for outstanding lead actress; and both Tadanobu Asano and Takehiro Hira competing for outstanding supporting actor. In total, “Shōgun” received 25 nominations, the most of any series this year, which helped FX garner 93 nominations — a new high for the network. Television’s biggest night, the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards, will take place at 8 p.m. ET tonight at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The ceremony will air on ABC and stream the next day on Hulu. Live red carpet coverage begins at 6 p.m. ET on ABC. You can follow along with live updates on this page for all the fashion, award winners and buzzy moments. The father and son duo Eugene and Dan Levy, who co-starred in the Emmy-winning sitcom “Schitt’s Creek,” are tonight’s hosts of the 76th Emmy Awards. The two said in a joint statement last month that they are “thrilled to able to raise a glass to this extraordinary season of television.” The pair will follow most recent Emmys hosts Anthony Anderson, Kenan Thompson and Cedric the Entertainer. No, you’re not imagining things. It was “television’s biggest night” a matter of months ago. Due to a pair of Hollywood strikes, the 75th Emmy Awards were postponed until last January. When the delayed awards show finally took place, we saw “The Bear” and “Succession” as the biggest winners, picking up six Emmys each. The industry’s writers and actors remain back at work and we return to our regularly scheduled programming: Tonight’s awards will celebrate shows released between June 1, 2023 and May 31, 2024. “Succession” has concluded, having used its strong showing at the January awards to cement its status as one of the best drama series in recent years. But “The Bear” looks poised to have another big night on the back of its critically lauded second season. The FX hit’s third season was released in June and will be eligible to contend during next year’s Emmys.  The nominees for the 76th Emmy Awards — television’s top honor — were announced earlier this summer, and “The Bear” ate it up. The beloved FX series, set in a Chicago sandwich shop-turned-high-end eatery, scored 23 nominations this year, breaking the record of 22 set by the NBC hit “30 Rock” back in 2009. In the drama category, “Shōgun” had the most nominations this year with 25. The all-time record of 32 nominations, held by HBO’s “Game of Thrones” since 2016, remains unbroken. HBO is owned by CNN’s parent company. Some past favorites, including “Succession” and “Ted Lasso,” were not in contention this year, but “The Crown,” “The Morning Show” and “Only Murders in the Building” became the new “legacy shows” with multiple nominations. Here are some of the nominees to watch tonight: Outstanding drama series: Outstanding comedy series: Outstanding limited series: Outstanding reality/competition series: Outstanding talk series: Outstanding lead actor in a comedy series: Outstanding lead actress in a drama series: See the full list of nominees here."
